{"name":"CAS","tagline":"Apereo CAS - Single Sign On for the Web","body":"# Central Authentication Service (CAS)\r\n\r\n<http://www.jasig.org/cas>\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThe Central Authentication Service (CAS) is the standard mechanism by which web\r\napplications should authenticate users. Any custom applications written benefit\r\nfrom using CAS.\r\n\r\nNote that CAS provides authentication; that is, it determines that your users\r\nare who they say they are. CAS should not be viewed as an access-control system;\r\nin particular, providers of applications that grant access to anyone who\r\npossesses a NetID should understand that loose affiliates of an organization may\r\nbe granted NetIDs.\r\n\r\n## Release info\r\n\r\nCAS requires J2SE 1.5 and J2EE1.3.\r\n\r\n## Distribution JAR files\r\n\r\nThe \"modules\" directory contains distinct jars for each Maven module.  It also\r\ncontains a war file that can be used for demo purposes.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n## Deployment\r\n\r\n* Servlet Container that can handle JSP 2.0 (e.g., Tomcat 5.0.28)\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nIf building CAS from the source, running the test cases currently\r\nrequires an active Internet connection.\r\n\r\nPlease [see the maven docs][skip] on how to disable the tests.\r\n\r\n[skip]: http://maven.apache.org/general.html#skip-test\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
