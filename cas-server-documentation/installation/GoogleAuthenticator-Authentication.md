title: CAS - Google Authenticator Authentication
---

# Google Authenticator Authentication

Google Authenticator generates 2-step verification codes on your phone. With 2-step verification signing in will require a code generated by the Google Authenticator app in addition to primary authentication.

Start by visiting the [Google documentation](https://accounts.google.com/SmsAuthConfig).

Support is enabled by including the following module in the Overlay:

```xml
<dependency>
     <groupId>org.apereo.cas</groupId>
     <artifactId>cas-server-support-gauth</artifactId>
     <version>${cas.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Configuration

To see the relevant list of CAS properties, please [review this guide](Configuration-Properties.html).

## Registration

By defaults, an account registry implementation is included that collects user device registration and saves them into memory. 
This option should only be used for demo and testing purposes. Production deployments of this feature will require a separate
implementation of the registry that is capable to register accounts into persistent storage. 

To provide such an option, provide an implementation of `GoogleAuthenticatorAccountRegistry`. Make sure your implementation
is named `googleAuthenticatorAccountRegistry` in the Spring configuration.
