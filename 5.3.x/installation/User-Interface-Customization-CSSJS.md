# CSS

The default styles are all contained in two single files located in `src/main/resources/static/css/cas.css` and `src/main/resources/static/css/admin.css`. This location is set in `cas-theme-default.properties`.
If you would like to create your own `css/custom.css file`, for example, you will need to update `cas.standard.css.file` key in that file.

```bash
cas.standard.css.file=/css/cas.css
cas.admin.css.file=/css/admin.css
cas.javascript.file=/js/cas.js
```

## Responsive Design

CSS media queries bring responsive design features to CAS which would allow adopter to focus on one theme for all appropriate devices and platforms. These queries are defined in the same `cas.css` file.

# Javascript

If you need to add some JavaScript, feel free to append `src/main/resources/static/js/cas.js`.

You can also create your own `custom.js` file, for example, and call it from within `bottom.html` like so:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/custom.js"></script>
```

If you are developing themes per service, each theme also has the ability to specify a custom `cas.js` file under the `cas.javascript.file` setting.

Most importantly, the following Javascript libraries are utilized by CAS automatically:

* JQuery
* JQuery UI
* JQuery Cookie
* Bootstrap

## Asynchronous Script Loading

CAS will attempt load the aforementioned script libraries asynchronously so as to not block the page rendering functionality.
The loading of script files is handled by the [`head.js` library](http://headjs.com) and is the responsibility of some javascript in the `bottom.html` template fragment which calls some methods in the `cas.js` file.

The only script that is loaded synchronously is the `head.js` library itself.

Because scripts, and specially JQuery are loaded asynchronously, any custom Javascript that is placed inside the page
that relies on these libraries may not immediately function on page load. CAS provides a callback function that allows
adopters to be notified when script loading has completed and this would be a safe time to execute/load other Javascript-related
functions that depend on JQuery inside the actual page.

```javascript
function jqueryReady() {
    //Custom Javascript tasks can be carried out now via JQuery...
}
```

## Checking CAPSLOCK

CAS will display a brief warning when the CAPSLOCK key is turned on during the typing of the credential password. This check is enforced by the `cas.js` file.

## Browser Cookie Support

For CAS to honor a single sign-on session, the browser MUST support and accept cookies. CAS will notify the
user if the browser has turned off its support for cookies. This behavior is controlled via the `cas.js` file.

## Preserving Anchor Fragments

Anchors/fragments may be lost across redirects as the server-side handler of the form post ignores the client-side anchor, unless appended to the form POST url. This is needed if you want a CAS-authenticated application to be able to use anchors/fragments when bookmarking. CAS is configured by default to preserve anchor fragments where and when specified. There is nothing further for you to do.

### WebJARs for Javascript/CSS Libraries

The CAS application application packages third party static resources inside the CAS webapp rather than referencing CDN links so that CAS may be deployed on 
networks with limited internet access.

The 3rd party static resources are packaged in "WebJAR" jar files and served up via the servlet `3.0` feature 
that merges any folders under `META-INF/resources` in web application jars with the application's web root.

For developers modifying CAS, if adding or modifying a 3rd party library, the steps are:

- Add WebJAR dependency to `dependencies.gradle` in the `ext.library.webjars` section.
- Add dependency version to `gradle.properties` and use it in `dependency.gradle`.
- Add entry to `core/cas-server-core-web/src/main/resources/cas_common_messages.properties` for each resource (e.g. js or css). 
- Reference the version from `gradle.properties` in the URL and it will be filtered in at build time).

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Resource Caching</strong><p>The build attempts to rebuild all relevant modules again when version numbers change and resources upgraded. If you do need to forcefully remove cached artifacts and repackage the application anew, run the build's <code>clean</code> task inside the <code>core/cas-server-core-web</code> module.</p></div>

For example:

```properties
webjars.zxcvbn.js=/webjars/zxcvbn/${zxcvbnVersion}/zxcvbn.js
```

Then Reference the entry from `cas_common_messages.properties` in the relevant view (i.e HTML page) where the entry is `webjars.zxcvbn.js`:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" th:src="@{#{webjars.zxcvbn.js}}"></script>
```

#### Building WebJARs

You can search for webjars at http://webjars.org. There are three flavors of WebJARs that you can read about but the NPM and Bower types can be created automatically for any version (if they don't already exist) as long as there exists an NPM or Bower package for the web resources you want to use. Click the "Add a webjar" button and follow the instructions. If customizing the UI in an overlay, the deployer can add webjars as dependencies to their overlay project and reference the URLs of the resource either directly in an html file or via adding an entry to a `common_messages.properties` file in the overlay project's `src\main\resources` folder.
