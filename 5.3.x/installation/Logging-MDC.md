#  Mapped Diagnostic Context

To uniquely stamp each request, CAS puts contextual
information into the `MDC`, the abbreviation of Mapped Diagnostic Context. This effectively
translates to a number of special variables available to the logging context that
may convey additional information about the nature of the request or the authentication event.

| Variable                                     | Description
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------
| `remoteAddress`                     | Remote address of the HTTP request.
| `remoteUser`                        | Remote user of the HTTP request.
| `serverName`                        | Server name of the HTTP request.
| `serverPort`                        | Server port of the HTTP request.
| `locale`                            | Locale of the HTTP request.
| `contentType`                       | Content type of the HTTP request.
| `contextPath`                       | Context path of the HTTP request.
| `localAddress`                      | Local address of the HTTP request.
| `localPort`                         | Local port of the HTTP request.
| `remotePort`                        | Remote port of the HTTP request.
| `pathInfo`                          | Path information of the HTTP request.
| `protocol`                          | Protocol of the HTTP request.
| `authType`                          | Authentication type of the HTTP request.
| `method`                            | Method of the HTTP request.
| `queryString`                       | Query string of the HTTP request.
| `requestUri`                        | Request URI of the HTTP request.
| `scheme`                            | Scheme of the HTTP request.
| `timezone`                          | Timezone of the HTTP request.
| `principal`                         | CAS authenticated principal id.

Additionally, all available request attributes, headers, and parameters are exposed as variables.

The above variables may be used in logging patterns:

- Use `%X` by itself to include all variables.
- Use `%X{key}` to include the specified variable.

```xml
<Console name="console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
    <PatternLayout pattern="%X{locale} %d %p [%c] - &lt;%m&gt;%n"/>
</Console>
```
