# CAS Spring Boot Administration

CAS takes advantage of the [Spring Boot Admin][bootadmindocs] to manage and monitor its internal state visually. As a Spring Boot Admin client, CAS registers itself with the Spring Boot Admin server over HTTP and reports back its status and health to the server's web interface.

## Administration Server

To run the Spring Boot Admin server, please use [this WAR overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-bootadmin-overlay).

<div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Secure Endpoints</strong><p>Note that the admin server's API endpoints MUST be secured. It is also best to run both the Admin server and the registering CAS server node under HTTPS, specially if credentials are used to authenticate into endpoints.</p></div>

To learn more about options, please [see this guide][bootadmindocs].

## CAS Server as Client

Each individual CAS server is given the ability to auto-register itself with the admin server, provided configuration is made available to instruct the CAS server how to locate and connect to the admin server.

Support is added by including the following dependency in the WAR overlay:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apereo.cas</groupId>
    <artifactId>cas-server-support-bootadmin-client</artifactId>
    <version>${cas.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Note that CAS server's actuator endpoints are by default secured. In order to allow secure communication between the CAS server and the Spring Boot Admin server, [please see guide][bootadmindocs].

## Configuration

To see the relevant list of CAS properties, please [review this guide](Configuration-Properties.html#spring-boot-admin-server).
