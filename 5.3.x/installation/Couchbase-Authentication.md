# Couchbase Authentication

Verify and authenticate credentials using [Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.com/).

Support is enabled by including the following dependency in the WAR overlay:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apereo.cas</groupId>
  <artifactId>cas-server-support-couchbase-authentication</artifactId>
  <version>${cas.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

The authentication strategy is able to fetch user attributes as part of the authentication event. To see the relevant list of CAS properties, please [review this guide](Configuration-Properties.html#couchbase-authentication).

## Couchbase Principal Attributes

The above dependency may also be used, in the event that principal attributes need to be fetched from a Couchbase database without necessarily authenticating credentials against Couchbase. To see the relevant list of CAS properties, please [review this guide](Configuration-Properties.html#couchbase).
