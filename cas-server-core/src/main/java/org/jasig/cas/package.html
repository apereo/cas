<p>This is the entry point to the part of the CAS processing that is independent
of the user/program interface. This layer is mostly a service to create, manage,
validate, query, and destroy tickets. The caller of this layer may be a Web
application running in a Servlet container, but it may also be a Web Service
client, RMI client, or even a program that finds these services compelling.</p>
<p>One first enters this layer with opaque Credentials requesting creation of a
TGT. The Credentials are &quot;opaque&quot; because they are an object whose nature is
irrelevant to CAS. The Credentials are carried through the layers until they can
be presented to plugin configuration beans that may recognize the underlying
type and process it. Simple Credentials might be an object with a userid and
password, but they may also be an X.509 Certificate, Kerberos Ticket, Shibboleth
artifact, XML SOAP header, or any other object.</p>
<p>The Credentials are presented to a set of objects plugged into the
Authentication process by the system administrators. If one of these plugin
elements recognizes the Credentials, validates their integrity, and maps them to
the identity of a user in the local system, then CAS has logged someone on and
creates a TGT.</p>
<p>The results of the login are somewhat opaque. The TGT references an
Authentication object that references a Principal. Minimally the Principal
contains a simple ID string. What else the Principal or Authentication object
contain are transparent to CAS. These objects must be Serializable, because the
Tickets and everything they reference may need to be checkpointed to disk or
shared with multiple machines in a clustering configuration. CAS is managing the
TGT and, as a result, it also saves everything in the concrete classes
referenced by it.</p>
<p>Any additional information about the User fetched at login is of no direct
interest to CAS. It may, however, be meaningful to the caller of this layer. In
the case of an HTTP Servlet interface, this would be the View layer that
generates, among other things, the response to the Ticket Validation query.</p>
<p>Having created a TGT, CAS then proceeds to create Service Tickets which are
chained off the TGT, and in the case of Proxy authentication creates chains of
TGTs for the Service Ticket. TGTs and STs are stored in a cache until they
expire or are deleted. Various technologies can be plugged into the back end so
that the Ticket cache is shared among machines or persisted across a reboot.</p>
