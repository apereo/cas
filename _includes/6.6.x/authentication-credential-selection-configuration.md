Certain authentication handlers are allowed to determine whether they can operate on the provided credential
and as such lend themselves to be tried and tested during the authentication handler selection phase. The credential criteria
may be one of the following options:

- A regular expression pattern that is tested against the credential identifier.
- A fully qualified class name of your own design that looks similar to the below example:

```java
import java.util.function.Predicate;
import org.apereo.cas.authentication.Credential;

public class PredicateExample implements Predicate<Credential> {
    @Override
    public boolean test(final Credential credential) {
        // Examine the credential and return true/false
    }
}
```

- Path to an external Groovy script that looks similar to the below example:

```groovy
import org.apereo.cas.authentication.Credential
import java.util.function.Predicate

class PredicateExample implements Predicate<Credential> {
    @Override
    boolean test(final Credential credential) {
        // test and return result
    }
}
```
