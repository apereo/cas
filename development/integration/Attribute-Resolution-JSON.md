# JSON Attribute Resolution

Source: https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Resolution-JSON.html

The following configuration describes how to fetch and retrieve attributes from JSON attribute repositories.

If you wish to directly and separately retrieve attributes from a static JSON source, the following settings are then relevant:

The following settings and properties are available from the CAS configuration catalog:

- `cas.authn.attribute-repository.json[0].location` (Required; type `Resource`): The location of the resource. Resources can be URLs, or files found either on the classpath or outside somewhere in the file system. In the event the configured resource is a Groovy script, especially if the script is set to reload on changes, you may need to adjust the total number of `inotify` instances. On Linux, you may need to add the following line to `/etc/sysctl.conf`: `fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 256`. You can check the current value via `cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances`. In situations and scenarios where CAS is able to automatically watch the underlying resource for changes and detect updates and modifications dynamically, you may be able to specify the following setting as either an environment variable or system property with a value of `false` to disable the resource watcher: `org.apereo.cas.util.io.PathWatcherService`.
- `cas.authn.attribute-repository.json` (Optional; type `List<JsonPrincipalAttributesProperties>`): Retrieve attributes from multiple JSON file repositories.
- `cas.authn.attribute-repository.json[0].id` (Optional; type `String`): A value can be assigned to this field to uniquely identify this resolver.
- `cas.authn.attribute-repository.json[0].order` (Optional; type `int`): The order of this attribute repository in the chain of repositories. Can be used to explicitly position this source in chain and affects merging strategies.
- `cas.authn.attribute-repository.json[0].state` (Optional; type `AttributeRepositoryStates`; default `ACTIVE`): Whether attribute resolution based on this source is enabled. Available values are as follows: - `ACTIVE`: Active and enabled repository, and is invoked by default automatically. - `DISABLED`: Attribute repository is disabled and will not be used to resolve people and attributes. - `STANDBY`: Repository is in a semi-enabled state, waiting to be called only on-demand when explicitly asked for and will not be registered into the resolution plan.

The format of the file may be:

```json
{
    "user1": {
        "firstName":["Json1"],
        "lastName":["One"]
    },
    "user2": {
        "firstName":["Json2"],
        "eduPersonAffiliation":["employee", "student"]
    }
}
```
