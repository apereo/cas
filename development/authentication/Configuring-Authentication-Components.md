# Configuration

Source: https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/authentication/Configuring-Authentication-Components.html

The CAS authentication process is primarily controlled by an authentication manager, which orchestrates a collection of authentication handlers.

## Authentication Manager

CAS ships with a single yet flexible authentication manager which performs authentication according to the following contract.

For any given credential the manager does the following:

1. Iterate over all configured authentication handlers.
2. Attempt to authenticate a credential if a handler supports it.
3. On success attempt to resolve a principal.
4. Check whether a resolver is configured for the handler that authenticated the credential.
5. If a suitable resolver is found, attempt to resolve the principal.
6. If a suitable resolver is not found, use the principal resolved by the authentication handler.
7. Check whether the security policy (e.g. any, all) is satisfied.
8. If security policy is met return immediately.
9. Continue if security policy is not met.
10. After all credentials have been attempted check security policy again and throw `AuthenticationException` if not satisfied.

There is an implicit security policy that requires at least one handler to successfully authenticate a credential.

## Authentication Handlers

There are a variety of authentication handlers and methods supported by CAS. Use the menu to navigate around the site and choose. By default, CAS is configured to accept a pre-defined set of credentials that are supplied via the CAS configuration.

> **Default Credentials**
>
> To test the default authentication scheme in CAS, use **casuser** and ** Mellon** as the username and password respectively. These are automatically configured via the static authentication handler, and ** MUST** be removed from the configuration prior to production rollouts.

The following settings and properties are available from the CAS configuration catalog:

- `cas.authn.accept.password-encoder.encoding-algorithm` (Required; type `String`): The encoding algorithm to use such as `MD5`. Relevant when the type used is `DEFAULT` or `GLIBC_CRYPT`. When used with `PasswordEncoderTypes#PBKDF2`, it should be one of `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1`, `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256` or `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512`.
- `cas.authn.accept.password-encoder.type` (Required; type `String`; default `NONE`): Define the password encoder type to use. Type may be specified as blank or `NONE` to disable password encoding. It may also refer to a fully-qualified class name that implements the Spring Security's `PasswordEncoder` interface if you wish you define your own encoder. The following types may be used: - `NONE`: No password encoding (i.e. plain-text) takes place. - `DEFAULT`: Use the `DefaultPasswordEncoder` of CAS. For message-digest algorithms via `character-encoding` and `encoding-algorithm`. - `BCRYPT`: Use the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` based on the strength provided and an optional secret. - `SCRYPT`: Use the `SCryptPasswordEncoder`. - `PBKDF2`: Use the `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` based on the strength provided and an optional secret. - `STANDARD`: Use the `StandardPasswordEncoder` based on the secret provided. - `SSHA`: Use the `LdapShaPasswordEncoder` supports Ldap SHA and SSHA (salted-SHA). The values are base-64 encoded and have the label {SHA} or {SSHA} prepended to the encoded hash. - `GLIBC_CRYPT`: Use the `GlibcCryptPasswordEncoder` based on the `encoding-algorithm`, strength provided and an optional secret. - `org.example.MyEncoder`: An implementation of `PasswordEncoder` of your own choosing. - `file:///path/to/script.groovy`: Path to a Groovy script charged with handling password encoding operations.
- `cas.authn.accept.password-policy.groovy.location` (Required; type `Resource`): The location of the resource. Resources can be URLs, or files found either on the classpath or outside somewhere in the file system. In the event the configured resource is a Groovy script, especially if the script is set to reload on changes, you may need to adjust the total number of `inotify` instances. On Linux, you may need to add the following line to `/etc/sysctl.conf`: `fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 256`. You can check the current value via `cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances`. In situations and scenarios where CAS is able to automatically watch the underlying resource for changes and detect updates and modifications dynamically, you may be able to specify the following setting as either an environment variable or system property with a value of `false` to disable the resource watcher: `org.apereo.cas.util.io.PathWatcherService`.
- `cas.authn.accept.principal-transformation.groovy.location` (Required; type `Resource`): The location of the resource. Resources can be URLs, or files found either on the classpath or outside somewhere in the file system. In the event the configured resource is a Groovy script, especially if the script is set to reload on changes, you may need to adjust the total number of `inotify` instances. On Linux, you may need to add the following line to `/etc/sysctl.conf`: `fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 256`. You can check the current value via `cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances`. In situations and scenarios where CAS is able to automatically watch the underlying resource for changes and detect updates and modifications dynamically, you may be able to specify the following setting as either an environment variable or system property with a value of `false` to disable the resource watcher: `org.apereo.cas.util.io.PathWatcherService`.
- `cas.authn.accept.users` (Required; type `String`): Accepted users for authentication, in the syntax of `uid::password`.
- `cas.authn.accept.credential-criteria` (Optional; type `String`): A number of authentication handlers are allowed to determine whether they can operate on the provided credential and as such lend themselves to be tried and tested during the authentication handler selection phase. The credential criteria may be one of the following options: - 1) A regular expression pattern that is tested against the credential identifier. - 2) A fully qualified class name of your own design that implements `Predicate`. - 3) Path to an external Groovy script that implements the same interface.

**Groovy scripting**

CAS takes advantage of Apache Groovy in forms of either embedded or external scripts that allow one to, by default, dynamically build constructs, attributes, access strategies and a lot more. To activate the functionality described here, you may need to prepare CAS to support and integrate with Apache Groovy.

Please [review this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Apache-Groovy-Scripting.html) to configure your build.

**Authentication**

Certain authentication handlers are allowed to determine whether they can operate on the provided credential and as such lend themselves to be tried and tested during the authentication handler selection phase. The credential criteria may be one of the following options:

- A regular expression pattern that is tested against the credential identifier.
- A fully qualified class name of your own design that looks similar to the below example:

```java
import java.util.function.Predicate;
import org.apereo.cas.authentication.Credential;

public class PredicateExample implements Predicate<Credential> {
    @Override
    public boolean test(final Credential credential) {
        // Examine the credential and return true/false
    }
}
```

- Path to an external Groovy script that looks similar to the below example:

```groovy
import org.apereo.cas.authentication.Credential
import java.util.function.Predicate

class PredicateExample implements Predicate<Credential> {
    @Override
    boolean test(final Credential credential) {
        // test and return result
    }
}
```

To prepare CAS to support and integrate with Apache Groovy, please [review this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development//integration/Apache-Groovy-Scripting.html).

**Password encoding**

If you need to design your own password encoding scheme where the type is specified as a fully qualified Java class name, the structure of the class would be similar to the following:

```java
package org.example.cas;

import org.springframework.security.crypto.codec.*;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.*;

public class MyEncoder extends AbstractPasswordEncoder {
    @Override
    protected byte[] encode(CharSequence rawPassword, byte[] salt) {
        return ...
    }
}
```

If you need to design your own password encoding scheme where the type is specified as a path to a Groovy script, the structure of the script would be similar to the following:

```groovy
import java.util.*

byte[] run(final Object... args) {
    def (rawPassword,generatedSalt,logger,applicationContext) = args
    logger.debug("Encoding password...")
    return ...
}

Boolean matches(final Object... args) {
    def (rawPassword,encodedPassword,logger,applicationContext) = args
    logger.debug("Does match or not ?");
    return ...
```

To prepare CAS to support and integrate with Apache Groovy, please [review this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development//integration/Apache-Groovy-Scripting.html).

**Password policy**

**Password Policy Strategies**

If the password policy strategy is to be handed off to a Groovy script, the outline of the script may be as follows:

```groovy
import java.util.*
import org.ldaptive.auth.*
import org.apereo.cas.*
import org.apereo.cas.authentication.*
import org.apereo.cas.authentication.support.*

List<MessageDescriptor> run(final Object... args) {
    def (response,configuration,logger,applicationContext) = args
    logger.info("Handling password policy [{}] via ${configuration.getAccountStateHandler()}", response)

    def accountStateHandler = configuration.getAccountStateHandler()
    return accountStateHandler.handle(response, configuration)
}
```

The parameters passed are as follows:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `response` | The LDAP authentication response of type `org.ldaptive.auth.AuthenticationResponse` |
| `configuration` | The LDAP password policy configuration carrying the account state handler defined. |
| `logger` | The object responsible for issuing log messages such as `logger.info(...)`. |
| `applicationContext` | The Spring `ApplicationContext` that allows one to interact with the runtime. |

To prepare CAS to support and integrate with Apache Groovy, please [review this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development//integration/Apache-Groovy-Scripting.html).

**Principal transformation**

Authentication handlers that generally deal with username-password credentials can be configured to transform the user id prior to executing the authentication sequence. Each authentication strategy in CAS provides settings to properly transform the principal. Refer to the relevant settings for the authentication strategy at hand to learn more.

Authentication handlers as part of principal transformation may also be provided a path to a Groovy script to transform the provided username. The outline of the script may take on the following form:

```groovy
String run(final Object... args) {
    def (providedUsername,logger) = args
    return providedUsername.concat("SomethingElse")
}
```

To prepare CAS to support and integrate with Apache Groovy, please [review this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development//integration/Apache-Groovy-Scripting.html).

### Actuator Endpoints

The following endpoints are provided by CAS:

`authenticationHandlers`

CAS endpoint · 2 operations · Not exposed by default · cas-server-support-reports

**GET** `authenticationHandlers`: Get collection of available authentication handlers. (no params)

Response

- **Returns**: `Collection`
- **Produces**: `application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v2+json, application/vnd.cas.services+yaml, application/json`
- **Java method**: `handle()`
- **Defined in**: `RegisteredAuthenticationHandlersEndpoint`

Example request

```bash
curl -u "casuser:password" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v2+json" \
  "https://sso.example.org/cas/actuator/authenticationHandlers"
```

**GET** `authenticationHandlers/{name}`: Get available authentication handler by name. (1 param)

Parameters

| Name | In | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name`required | query | – | The handler name |

Response

- **Returns**: `AuthenticationHandlerDetails`
- **Produces**: `application/json, application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v2+json, application/vnd.cas.services+yaml`
- **Java method**: `fetchAuthnHandler(String)`
- **Defined in**: `RegisteredAuthenticationHandlersEndpoint`

Example request

```bash
curl -u "casuser:password" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  "https://sso.example.org/cas/actuator/authenticationHandlers/{name}?name=..."
```

**Enable & expose**

Include the module that provides this endpoint in the WAR overlay:

```groovy
dependencies {
    /*
        The following platform references are included automatically and are listed for reference only.

        implementation enforcedPlatform("org.apereo.cas:cas-server-support-bom:${project.'cas.version'}")
        implementation platform(org.springframework.boot.gradle.plugin.SpringBootPlugin.BOM_COORDINATES)
        
    */
    implementation "org.apereo.cas:cas-server-support-reports"
}
```

Turn the endpoint on and expose it over the web. One entry covers every operation. By default only `info`, `health` and `status` are exposed.

```properties
management.endpoint.authenticationHandlers.access=UNRESTRICTED
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=authenticationHandlers
```

Endpoints may be mapped to other paths. For example, to serve `health` at `healthcheck`:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.path-mapping.health=healthcheck
```

**Security**

Once exposed, every call goes through [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security), and CAS decides access per endpoint. Without a rule, the special `defaults` endpoint applies, which denies access.

Who may call it

*Authenticated*

```properties
cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.authenticationHandlers.access=AUTHENTICATED
```

*Role*

```properties
cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.authenticationHandlers.access=ROLE
cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.authenticationHandlers.required-roles=ADMIN
```

*IP address*

```properties
cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.authenticationHandlers.access=IP_ADDRESS
cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.authenticationHandlers.required-ip-addresses=127.0.0.1
```

*Anyone*

```properties
cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.authenticationHandlers.access=PERMIT
```

Where credentials are checked

*Basic*

A single user defined in CAS settings. If the name and password are left undefined, CAS generates them at startup.

- `spring.security.user.name` (Third party; type `String`; default `user`): Default user name.
- `spring.security.user.password` (Third party; type `String`): Password for the default user name.
- `spring.security.user.roles` (Third party; type `List<String>`): Granted roles for the default user name.

*JAAS*

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jaas.login-config` (Optional; type `Resource`): JAAS login resource file.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jaas.login-context-name` (Optional; type `String`): The login context name should coincide with a given index in the login config specified. This name is used as the index to the configuration specified in the login config property. ``` JAASTest { org.springframework.security.authentication.jaas.TestLoginModule required; }; ``` In the above example, `JAASTest` should be set as the context name.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jaas.refresh-configuration-on-startup` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `true`): If set, a call to `Configuration#refresh()` will be made by `#configureJaas(Resource)` method.

*LDAP*

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.base-dn` (Required; type `String`): Base DN to use. There may be scenarios where different parts of a single LDAP tree could be considered as base-dns. Rather than duplicating the LDAP configuration block for each individual base-dn, each entry can be specified and joined together using a special delimiter character. The user DN is retrieved using the combination of all base-dn and DN resolvers in the order defined. DN resolution should fail if multiple DNs are found. Otherwise the first DN found is returned. Usual syntax is: `subtreeA,dc=example,dc=net|subtreeC,dc=example,dc=net`.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.bind-credential` (Required; type `String`): The bind credential to use when connecting to LDAP.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.bind-dn` (Required; type `String`): The bind DN to use when connecting to LDAP. LDAP connection configuration injected into the LDAP connection pool can be initialized with the following parameters: - `bindDn/bindCredential` provided - Use the provided credentials to bind when initializing connections. - `bindDn/bindCredential` set to `*` - Use a fast-bind strategy to initialize the pool. - `bindDn/bindCredential` set to blank - Skip connection initializing; perform operations anonymously. - SASL mechanism provided - Use the given SASL mechanism to bind when initializing connections.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.ldap-url` (Required; type `String`): The LDAP url to the server. More than one may be specified, separated by space and/or comma.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.search-filter` (Required; type `String`): User filter to use for searching. Syntax is `cn={user}` or `cn={0}`. You may also provide an external groovy script in the syntax of `file:/path/to/GroovyScript.groovy` to fully build the final filter template dynamically.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.type` (Required; type `AbstractLdapAuthenticationProperties.AuthenticationTypes`; default `AUTHENTICATED`): The authentication type. - `AD` - Users authenticate with `sAMAccountName`. - `AUTHENTICATED` - Manager bind/search type of authentication. If {@code} principalAttributePassword} is empty then a user simple bind is done to validate credentials. Otherwise the given attribute is compared with the given `principalAttributePassword` using the `SHA` encrypted value of it. - `ANONYMOUS`: Similar semantics as `AUTHENTICATED` except no `bindDn` and `bindCredential` may be specified to initialize the connection. If `principalAttributePassword` is empty then a user simple bind is done to validate credentials. Otherwise the given attribute is compared with the given `principalAttributePassword` using the `SHA` encrypted value of it. - DIRECT: Direct Bind - Compute user DN from format string and perform simple bind. This is relevant when no search is required to compute the DN needed for a bind operation. Use cases for this type are: 1) All users are under a single branch in the directory, `e.g. ou=Users,dc=example,dc=org.` 2) The username provided on the CAS login form is part of the DN, e.g. `uid=%s,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=org`.

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.block-wait-time` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT3S`): The length of time the pool will block. By default the pool will block indefinitely and there is no guarantee that waiting threads will be serviced in the order in which they made their request. This option should be used with a blocking connection pool when you need to control the exact number of connections that can be created
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.connect-timeout` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT5S`): Sets the maximum amount of time that connects will block.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.connection-strategy` (Optional; type `String`): If multiple URLs are provided as the ldapURL this describes how each URL will be processed. - `ACTIVE_PASSIVE` First LDAP will be used for every request unless it fails and then the next shall be used. - `ROUND_ROBIN` For each new connection the next url in the list will be used. - `RANDOM` For each new connection a random LDAP url will be selected. - `DNS_SRV` LDAP urls based on DNS SRV records of the configured/given LDAP url will be used.

The final value is always prefixed with `#groupPrefix`. This is useful in scenarios where you wish to grant access to a resource to all users who a member of a given group.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.ldap-authz.group-base-dn` (Optional; type `String`): Base DN to start the search looking for groups.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.ldap-authz.group-filter` (Optional; type `String`): Search filter to begin looking for groups.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.ldap-authz.group-prefix` (Optional; type `String`): A prefix that is prepended to the group attribute value to construct an authorized role.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.ldap-authz.role-attribute` (Optional; type `String`; default `uugid`): Attribute expected to be found on the entry whose value is going to be used to construct roles. The final value is always prefixed with `#rolePrefix`. This is useful in scenarios where you wish to grant access to a resource to all users who carry a special attribute.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.ldap-authz.role-prefix` (Optional; type `String`; default `ROLE_`): Prefix for the role.

See [RFC 2696](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2696.txt). This control is often used to work around server result size limits. A negative/zero value disables paged requests.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.pool-passivator` (Optional; type `String`; default `BIND`): You may receive unexpected LDAP failures, when CAS is configured to authenticate using `DIRECT` or `AUTHENTICATED` types and LDAP is locked down to not allow anonymous binds/searches. Every second attempt with a given LDAP connection from the pool would fail if it was on the same connection as a failed login attempt, and the regular connection validator would similarly fail. When a connection is returned back to a pool, it still may contain the principal and credentials from the previous attempt. Before the next bind attempt using that connection, the validator tries to validate the connection again but fails because it’s no longer trying with the configured bind credentials but with whatever user DN was used in the previous step. Given the validation failure, the connection is closed and CAS would deny access by default. Passivators attempt to reconnect to LDAP with the configured bind credentials, effectively resetting the connection to what it should be after each bind request. Furthermore if you are seeing errors in the logs that resemble a 'Operation exception encountered, reopening connection' type of message, this usually is an indication that the connection pool’s validation timeout established and created by CAS is greater than the timeout configured in the LDAP server, or more likely, in the load balancer in front of the LDAP servers. You can adjust the LDAP server session’s timeout for connections, or you can teach CAS to use a validity period that is equal or less than the LDAP server session’s timeout. Accepted values are: - `NONE`: No passivation takes place. - `BIND`: The default behavior which passivates a connection by performing a bind operation on it. This option requires the availability of bind credentials when establishing connections to LDAP.

**LDAP & Active Directory**

**LDAP Scriptable Search Filter**

LDAP search filters can point to an external Groovy script to dynamically construct the final filter template.

The script itself may be designed as:

```groovy
import org.ldaptive.*
import org.springframework.context.*

def run(Object[] args) {
    def (filter,parameters,applicationContext,logger) = args

    logger.info("Configuring LDAP filter")
    filter.setFilter("uid=something")
}
```

The following parameters are passed to the script:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `filter` | `FilterTemplate` to be updated by the script and used for the LDAP query. |
| `parameters` | Map of query parameters which may be used to construct the final filter. |
| `applicationContext` | Reference to the Spring `ApplicationContext` reference. |
| `logger` | The object responsible for issuing log messages such as `logger.info(...)`. |

To prepare CAS to support and integrate with Apache Groovy, please [review this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development//integration/Apache-Groovy-Scripting.html).

*JDBC*

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.driver-class` (Required; type `String`; default `org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver`): The JDBC driver used to connect to the database.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.password` (Required; type `String`): The database connection password.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.password-encoder.encoding-algorithm` (Required; type `String`): The encoding algorithm to use such as `MD5`. Relevant when the type used is `DEFAULT` or `GLIBC_CRYPT`. When used with `PasswordEncoderTypes#PBKDF2`, it should be one of `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1`, `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256` or `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512`.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.password-encoder.type` (Required; type `String`; default `NONE`): Define the password encoder type to use. Type may be specified as blank or `NONE` to disable password encoding. It may also refer to a fully-qualified class name that implements the Spring Security's `PasswordEncoder` interface if you wish you define your own encoder. The following types may be used: - `NONE`: No password encoding (i.e. plain-text) takes place. - `DEFAULT`: Use the `DefaultPasswordEncoder` of CAS. For message-digest algorithms via `character-encoding` and `encoding-algorithm`. - `BCRYPT`: Use the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` based on the strength provided and an optional secret. - `SCRYPT`: Use the `SCryptPasswordEncoder`. - `PBKDF2`: Use the `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` based on the strength provided and an optional secret. - `STANDARD`: Use the `StandardPasswordEncoder` based on the secret provided. - `SSHA`: Use the `LdapShaPasswordEncoder` supports Ldap SHA and SSHA (salted-SHA). The values are base-64 encoded and have the label {SHA} or {SSHA} prepended to the encoded hash. - `GLIBC_CRYPT`: Use the `GlibcCryptPasswordEncoder` based on the `encoding-algorithm`, strength provided and an optional secret. - `org.example.MyEncoder`: An implementation of `PasswordEncoder` of your own choosing. - `file:///path/to/script.groovy`: Path to a Groovy script charged with handling password encoding operations.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.url` (Required; type `String`; default `jdbc:hsqldb:mem:cas-hsql-database`): The database connection URL.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.user` (Required; type `String`; default `sa`): The database user. The database user must have sufficient permissions to be able to handle schema changes and updates, when needed.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.autocommit` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): The default auto-commit behavior of connections in the pool. Determined whether queries such as update/insert should be immediately executed without waiting for an underlying transaction.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.batch-size` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `100`): A non-zero value enables use of JDBC2 batch updates by Hibernate. e.g. recommended values between 5 and 30.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.connection-timeout` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT30S`): Indicates the maximum number of milliseconds that the service can wait to obtain a connection.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.data-source-name` (Optional; type `String`): Attempts to do a JNDI data source look up for the data source name specified. Will attempt to locate the data source object as is.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.ddl-auto` (Optional; type `String`; default `update`): Hibernate feature to automatically validate and exports DDL to the schema. By default, creates and drops the schema automatically when a session is starts and ends. Setting the value to `validate` or `none` may be more desirable for production, but any of the following options can be used: - `validate`: Validate the schema, but make no changes to the database. - `update`: Update the schema. - `create`: Create the schema, destroying previous data. - `create-drop`: Drop the schema at the end of the session. - `none`: Do nothing. Note that during a version migration where any schema has changed `create-drop` will result in the loss of all data as soon as CAS is started. For transient data like tickets this is probably not an issue, but in cases like the audit table important data could be lost. Using `update`, while safe for data, is confirmed to result in invalid database state. `validate` or `none` settings are likely the only safe options for production use. For more info, [see this](http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api).
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.default-catalog` (Optional; type `String`): Qualifies unqualified table names with the given catalog in generated SQL.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.default-schema` (Optional; type `String`): Qualify unqualified table names with the given schema/tablespace in generated SQL.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.dialect` (Optional; type `String`; default `org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect`): The database dialect is a configuration setting for platform independent software (JPA, Hibernate, etc) which allows such software to translate its generic SQL statements into vendor specific DDL, DML.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.fail-fast-timeout` (Optional; type `Long`; default `1`): Set the pool initialization failure timeout. - Any value greater than zero will be treated as a timeout for pool initialization. The calling thread will be blocked from continuing until a successful connection to the database, or until the timeout is reached. If the timeout is reached, then a `PoolInitializationException` will be thrown. - A value of zero will *not* prevent the pool from starting in the case that a connection cannot be obtained. However, upon start the pool will attempt to obtain a connection and validate that the `connectionTestQuery` and `connectionInitSql` are valid. If those validations fail, an exception will be thrown. If a connection cannot be obtained, the validation is skipped and the pool will start and continue to try to obtain connections in the background. This can mean that callers to `DataSource#getConnection()` may encounter exceptions. - A value less than zero will *not* bypass any connection attempt and validation during startup, and therefore the pool will start immediately. The pool will continue to try to obtain connections in the background. This can mean that callers to `DataSource#getConnection()` may encounter exceptions. Note that if this timeout value is greater than or equal to zero (0), and therefore an initial connection validation is performed, this timeout does not override the `connectionTimeout` or `validationTimeout`; they will be honored before this timeout is applied. The default value is one millisecond.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.fetch-size` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `100`): Used to specify number of rows to be fetched in a select query.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.generate-statistics` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Allow hibernate to generate query statistics.

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.idle-timeout` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT10M`): Controls the maximum amount of time that a connection is allowed to sit idle in the pool.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.isolate-internal-queries` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): This property determines whether data source isolates internal pool queries, such as the connection alive test, in their own transaction. Since these are typically read-only queries, it is rarely necessary to encapsulate them in their own transaction. This property only applies if `#autocommit` is disabled.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.isolation-level-name` (Optional; type `String`; default `ISOLATION_READ_COMMITTED`): Defines the isolation level for transactions. @see org.springframework.transaction.TransactionDefinition
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.leak-threshold` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT6S`): Controls the amount of time that a connection can be out of the pool before a message is logged indicating a possible connection leak.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.password-encoder.character-encoding` (Optional; type `String`; default `UTF-8`): The encoding algorithm to use such as 'UTF-8'. Relevant when the type used is `DEFAULT`.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.password-encoder.hash-length` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `16`): When used by `PasswordEncoderTypes#ARGON2`, it indicates the hash strength/length.

Usually relevant when dealing with `PasswordEncoderTypes#BCRYPT`, `PasswordEncoderTypes#PBKDF2` or `PasswordEncoderTypes#GLIBC_CRYPT`. When used by `PasswordEncoderTypes#ARGON2` or `PasswordEncoderTypes#PBKDF2`, it indicates the salt strength.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.physical-naming-strategy-class-name` (Optional; type `String`; default `org.apereo.cas.hibernate.CasHibernatePhysicalNamingStrategy`): Fully-qualified name of the class that can control the physical naming strategy of hibernate.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.keep-alive-time` (Optional; type `String`; default `0`): This property controls the keepalive interval for a connection in the pool. An in-use connection will never be tested by the keepalive thread, only when it is idle will it be tested. Default is zero, which disables this feature.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.max-size` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `18`): Controls the maximum number of connections to keep in the pool, including both idle and in-use connections.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.max-wait` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT2S`): Sets the maximum time in seconds that this data source will wait while attempting to connect to a database. A value of zero specifies that the timeout is the default system timeout if there is one; otherwise, it specifies that there is no timeout.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.maximum-lifetime` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT10M`): This property controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool. When a connection reaches this timeout, even if recently used, it will be retired from the pool. An in-use connection will never be retired, only when it is idle will it be removed.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.min-size` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `6`): Controls the minimum size that the pool is allowed to reach, including both idle and in-use connections.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.name` (Optional; type `String`): Set the name of the connection pool. This is primarily used for the MBean to uniquely identify the pool configuration.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.suspension` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Whether or not pool suspension is allowed. There is a performance impact when pool suspension is enabled. Unless you need it (for a redundancy system for example) do not enable it.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.timeout-millis` (Optional; type `Long`; default `1000`): The maximum number of milliseconds that the pool will wait for a connection to be validated as alive.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.propagation-behavior-name` (Optional; type `String`; default `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED`): Defines the propagation behavior for transactions. @see org.springframework.transaction.TransactionDefinition
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.properties` (Optional; type `Map<String,String>`): Additional settings provided by Hibernate (or the connection provider) in form of key-value pairs.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.query` (Optional; type `String`): Query to execute in order to authenticate users via JDBC. Example: `SELECT username,password,enabled FROM users WHERE username=?`
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.read-only` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Configures the Connections to be added to the pool as read-only Connections.

- `cas.jdbc.physical-table-names` (Optional; type `Map<String,String>`): Indicate a physical table name to be used by the hibernate naming strategy in case table names need to be customized for the specific type of database. The key here indicates the CAS-provided table name and the value is the translate physical name for the database. If a match is not found for the CAS-provided table name, then that name will be used by default.
- `cas.jdbc.show-sql` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Whether SQL queries should be displayed in the console/logs.

**Password encoding**

If you need to design your own password encoding scheme where the type is specified as a fully qualified Java class name, the structure of the class would be similar to the following:

```java
package org.example.cas;

import org.springframework.security.crypto.codec.*;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.*;

public class MyEncoder extends AbstractPasswordEncoder {
    @Override
    protected byte[] encode(CharSequence rawPassword, byte[] salt) {
        return ...
    }
}
```

If you need to design your own password encoding scheme where the type is specified as a path to a Groovy script, the structure of the script would be similar to the following:

```groovy
import java.util.*

byte[] run(final Object... args) {
    def (rawPassword,generatedSalt,logger,applicationContext) = args
    logger.debug("Encoding password...")
    return ...
}

Boolean matches(final Object... args) {
    def (rawPassword,encodedPassword,logger,applicationContext) = args
    logger.debug("Does match or not ?");
    return ...
```

To prepare CAS to support and integrate with Apache Groovy, please [review this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development//integration/Apache-Groovy-Scripting.html).

*JSON*

A static list of users, passwords and roles in a JSON file. Supported password encodings are `{sha512}`, `{sha256}`, `{bcrypt}`, `{noop}`, `{pbkdf2}`, `{scrypt}` and `{argon2}`.

```json
[
    {
        "username": "casuser",
        "password": "{sha512}<hashed-password>",
        "authorities": [ "ROLE_ADMIN" ]
    }
]
```

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.json.location` (Required; type `Resource`): The location of the resource. Resources can be URLs, or files found either on the classpath or outside somewhere in the file system. In the event the configured resource is a Groovy script, especially if the script is set to reload on changes, you may need to adjust the total number of `inotify` instances. On Linux, you may need to add the following line to `/etc/sysctl.conf`: `fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 256`. You can check the current value via `cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances`. In situations and scenarios where CAS is able to automatically watch the underlying resource for changes and detect updates and modifications dynamically, you may be able to specify the following setting as either an environment variable or system property with a value of `false` to disable the resource watcher: `org.apereo.cas.util.io.PathWatcherService`.

**Troubleshooting**

- `404`: the endpoint is not enabled or not exposed; check the *Enable & expose* tab.
- `401` or `403`: the access rule or the credentials rejected the call; check the *Security* tab.

### Resolution Strategy

Please see [this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/authentication/Configuring-Authentication-Resolution.html) for more info.

### Authentication Sequence

At runtime, CAS maintains a collection of authentication handlers/strategies that typically execute one after another. Each CAS module that presents a form of authentication strategy will insert itself into this collection at bootstrap time. At the end of this process, the result of all authentication transactions is collected and optionally processed by an authentication policy where success/failure of certain strategies/sources may be taken into account to fully satisfy the authentication requirements. The collection of authentication handlers tries to preserve order in a rather more deterministic way. The idea is that adopters can assign an `order` value to an authentication handler thereby explicitly positioning it in the collection and controlling its execution sequence.

### Authentication Pre/Post Processing

Please see [this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/authentication/Configuring-Authentication-PrePostProcessing.html) for more details.

### Naming Strategy

Each authentication handler in CAS can be named via CAS settings and if left undefined, the short name of the handler component itself is used (i.e. `LdapAuthenticationHandler`). The name itself can be any arbitrary string and typically is used to identify and refer to the handler components in areas such as [required authentication for a service](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/services/Configuring-Service-AuthN-Policy.html), etc. In the event that multiple authentication handlers *of the same type* are defined, it is **RECOMMENDED** that each be given a unique name so as to avoid conflicts. Authentication failures are typically collected in CAS by the name of each authentication handler. Leaving the name undefined will likely result in subsequent components in the authentication chain overriding previous results.

## Authentication Policy

Please see [authentication security policies](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/authentication/Configuring-Authentication-Policy.html) for more details.

## Long Term Authentication

CAS has support for long term Ticket Granting Tickets, a feature that is also referred to as *“Remember Me”* to extend the length of the SSO session beyond the typical configuration. Please [see this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/authentication/Configuring-LongTerm-Authentication.html) for more details.

## Proxy Authentication

Please [see this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/authentication/Configuring-Proxy-Authentication.html) for more details.

## Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

Please [see this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/mfa/Configuring-Multifactor-Authentication.html) for more details.

## Login Throttling

CAS provides a facility for limiting failed login attempts to support password guessing and related abuse scenarios. Please [see this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/authentication/Configuring-Authentication-Throttling.html) for additional details on login throttling.

## SSO Session Cookie

A ticket-granting cookie is an HTTP cookie set by CAS upon the establishment of a single sign-on session. This cookie maintains login state for the client, and while it is valid, the client can present it to CAS in lieu of primary credentials. Please [see this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/authentication/Configuring-SSO.html) for additional details.
