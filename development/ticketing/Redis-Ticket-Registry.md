# Redis Ticket Registry

Source: https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/ticketing/Redis-Ticket-Registry.html

Redis integration is enabled by including the following dependency in the WAR overlay:

```groovy
dependencies {
    /*
        The following platform references are included automatically and are listed for reference only.

        implementation enforcedPlatform("org.apereo.cas:cas-server-support-bom:${project.'cas.version'}")
        implementation platform(org.springframework.boot.gradle.plugin.SpringBootPlugin.BOM_COORDINATES)
        
    */
    implementation "org.apereo.cas:cas-server-support-redis-ticket-registry"
}
```

This registry stores tickets in one or more [Redis](https://redis.io/) instances. CAS presents and uses Redis as a key/value store that accepts `String` keys and CAS ticket documents as values. The key is started with `CAS_TICKET:`.

The Redis ticket registry supports Redis Sentinel, which provides high availability for Redis. In practical terms this means that using Sentinel you can create a Redis deployment that resists without human intervention to certain kind of failures. Redis Sentinel also provides other collateral tasks such as monitoring, notifications and acts as a configuration provider for clients.

## Configuration

The following settings and properties are available from the CAS configuration catalog:

- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.cluster.nodes[0].host` (Required; type `String`): Server's host address.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.cluster.nodes[0].port` (Required; type `int`): Server's port number.

- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.cluster.password` (Required; type `String`): The cluster connection's password.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.cluster.username` (Required; type `String`): The cluster connection's username.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.crypto.encryption.key` (Required; type `String`): The encryption key. The encryption key by default and unless specified otherwise must be randomly-generated string whose length is defined by the encryption key size setting.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.crypto.signing.key` (Required; type `String`): The signing key is a string whose length is defined by the signing key size setting.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.database` (Required; type `Integer`; default `0`): Database index used by the connection factory.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.enabled` (Required; type `Boolean`; default `true`): Whether the module is enabled or not, defaults to true.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.host` (Required; type `String`; default `localhost`): Redis server host.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.password` (Required; type `String`): Login password of the redis server.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.pool.enabled` (Required; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Enable the pooling configuration.

- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.username` (Required; type `String`): Login username of the redis server.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.cache.cache-size` (Optional; type `Long`; default `10000`): This cache size specifies the maximum number of entries the cache may contain. Note that the cache may evict an entry before this limit is exceeded or temporarily exceed the threshold while evicting. As the cache size grows close to the maximum, the cache evicts entries that are less likely to be used again. For example, the cache may evict an entry because it hasn't been used recently or very often. Note: to disable the cache, you may choose a cache size of `0`.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.cache.initial-capacity` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `1000`): This cache capacity sets the minimum total size for the internal data structures. Providing a large enough estimate at construction time avoids the need for expensive resizing operations later, but setting this value unnecessarily high wastes memory.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.certificate-file` (Optional; type `File`): May be used when making SSL connections to build the trust manager. Sets the certificate file to use for client authentication. This is typically an `X.509` certificate file (or chain file) in PEM format.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.cluster.dynamic-refresh-sources` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `true`): Whether to discover and query all cluster nodes for obtaining the cluster topology. When set to false, only the initial seed nodes are used as sources for topology discovery.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.cluster.max-redirects` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `0`): The max number of redirects to follow.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.cluster.nodes` (Optional; type `List<RedisClusterNodeProperties>`): List of nodes available in the redis cluster.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.cluster.nodes[0].id` (Optional; type `String`): Identifier of this node.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.cluster.nodes[0].name` (Optional; type `String`): Name of this node.

- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.enable-redis-search` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `true`): Allows the register to detect the presence of Redis modules, in particular RediSearch, which allows the registry to create specific indexes and search Redis documents to look up tickets. Enabling indexing and searching capabilities may lead to significant performance improvements.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.keep-alive-count` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `0`): The maximum number of keepalive probes TCP should send before dropping the connection. By default, leaving this number at zero disables keepalive.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.keep-alive-idle-timeout` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT2H`): The time the connection needs to remain idle before TCP starts sending keepalive probes if keepalive is enabled.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.keep-alive-interval` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT60S`): The time the connection needs to remain idle before TCP starts sending keepalive probes.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.key-certificate-chain-file` (Optional; type `File`): May be used when making SSL connections to build the key manager. Sets the key certificate file to use for client authentication. This is typically an `X.509` certificate file (or chain file) in PEM format.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.key-file` (Optional; type `File`): May be used when making SSL connections. Sets the key file for client authentication. The key is reloaded on each connection attempt that allows CAS to replace certificates during runtime. This is typically a `PKCS#8` private key file in PEM format.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.key-password` (Optional; type `String`): The password of the `#keyFile`, or `null` if it's not password-protected.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.pool.fairness` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Returns whether or not the pool serves threads waiting to borrow objects fairly. True means that waiting threads are served as if waiting in a FIFO queue.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.pool.lifo` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `true`): Returns whether the pool has LIFO (last in, first out) behaviour with respect to idle objects - always returning the most recently used object from the pool, or as a FIFO (first in, first out) queue, where the pool always returns the oldest object in the idle object pool.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.pool.max-active` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `8`): Max number of connections that can be allocated by the pool at a given time. Use a negative value for no limit.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.pool.max-idle` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `8`): Max number of "idle" connections in the pool. Use a negative value to indicate an unlimited number of idle connections.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.pool.max-wait` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT5S`): Maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) a connection allocation should block before throwing an exception when the pool is exhausted. Use a negative value to block indefinitely.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.pool.min-evictable-idle-time-millis` (Optional; type `Long`; default `0`): Sets the minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction by the idle object evictor (if any - see setTimeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis(long)). When non-positive, no objects will be evicted from the pool due to idle time alone.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.pool.min-idle` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `0`): Target for the minimum number of idle connections to maintain in the pool. This setting only has an effect if it is positive.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.pool.num-tests-per-eviction-run` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `0`): Sets the maximum number of objects to examine during each run (if any) of the idle object evictor thread. When positive, the number of tests performed for a run will be the minimum of the configured value and the number of idle instances in the pool. When negative, the number of tests performed will be ceil(getNumIdle()/ abs(getNumTestsPerEvictionRun())) which means that when the value is -n roughly one nth of the idle objects will be tested per run.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.pool.soft-min-evictable-idle-time-millis` (Optional; type `Long`; default `0`): Sets the minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction by the idle object evictor (if any - see setTimeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis(long)), with the extra condition that at least minIdle object instances remain in the pool. This setting is overridden by getMinEvictableIdleTimeMillis() (that is, if getMinEvictableIdleTimeMillis() is positive, then getSoftMinEvictableIdleTimeMillis() is ignored).
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.pool.test-on-borrow` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Returns whether objects borrowed from the pool will be validated before being returned from the borrowObject() method. Validation is performed by the validateObject() method of the factory associated with the pool. If the object fails to validate, it will be removed from the pool and destroyed, and a new attempt will be made to borrow an object from the pool.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.pool.test-on-create` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Returns whether objects created for the pool will be validated before being returned from the borrowObject() method. Validation is performed by the validateObject() method of the factory associated with the pool. If the object fails to validate, then borrowObject() will fail.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.pool.test-on-return` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Returns whether objects borrowed from the pool will be validated when they are returned to the pool via the returnObject() method. Validation is performed by the validateObject() method of the factory associated with the pool. Returning objects that fail validation are destroyed rather then being returned the pool.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.pool.test-while-idle` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Returns whether objects sitting idle in the pool will be validated by the idle object evictor ( if any - see setTimeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis(long)). Validation is performed by the validateObject() method of the factory associated with the pool. If the object fails to validate, it will be removed from the pool and destroyed.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.pool.time-between-eviction-runs-millis` (Optional; type `Long`; default `-1`): Sets the amount of time (in milliseconds) between runs of the idle object evictor thread. When non-positive, no idle object evictor thread will be run. If positive, the idle object evictor thread will run at least once every timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis milliseconds, and will attempt to evict objects from the pool that are idle longer than getMinEvictableIdleTimeMillis() (if positive) or getSoftMinEvictableIdleTimeMillis() (if positive).
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.protocol-version` (Optional; type `String`; default `RESP3`): Redis protocol version.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.queue-identifier` (Optional; type `String`): Identifier for this CAS server node that tags the sender/receiver in the queue and avoid processing of inbound calls. If left blank, an identifier is generated automatically and kept in memory.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.read-from` (Optional; type `BaseRedisProperties.RedisReadFromTypes`): Setting that describes how Lettuce routes read operations to replica nodes. Note that modes referencing MASTER/SLAVE are deprecated (but still supported) in the Lettuce redis client dependency so migrate config to UPSTREAM/REPLICA. Available values are as follows: - `UPSTREAM`: Read from the current upstream node. - `UPSTREAMPREFERRED`: Read from the upstream node, but if it is unavailable, read from replica nodes. - `MASTER`: Read from the current upstream node. - `MASTERPREFERRED`: Read from the upstream node, but if it is unavailable, read from replica nodes. - `SLAVE`: Read from replica nodes. - `SLAVEPREFERRED`: Read from the replica nodes, but if none is unavailable, read from the upstream node. - `REPLICA`: Read from replica nodes. - `REPLICAPREFERRED`: Read from the replica nodes, but if none is unavailable, read from the upstream node. - `ANY`: Read from any node of the cluster. - `ANYREPLICA`: Read from any replica node of the cluster. - `NEAREST`: Read from the nearest node.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.sentinel.node` (Optional; type `List<String>`): list of host:port pairs.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.sentinel.password` (Optional; type `String`): Login password of the sentinel server.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.share-native-connections` (Optional; type `Boolean`): The shared native connection is never closed by Lettuce connection, therefore it is not validated by default when connections are retrieved. If this setting is `true`, a shared connection will be used for regular operations and a connection provider will be used to select a connection for blocking and tx operations only, which should not share a connection. If native connection sharing is disabled, new (or pooled) connections will be used for all operations. By default, multiple connections share a single thread-safe native connection. If you enable connection pooling, then native connection sharing will be disabled and the connection pool will be used for all operations. You may however explicitly control connection sharing via this setting as an override.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.start-tls` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Start mutual TLS. In order to support TLS, Redis should be configured with a X.509 certificate and a private key. In addition, it is necessary to specify a CA certificate bundle file or path to be used as a trusted root when validating certificates.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.timeout` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT60S`): Command timeout.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.uri` (Optional; type `String`): Database URI.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.use-ssl` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Whether or not to use SSL for connection factory.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.verify-peer` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `true`): Control how peer verification is handled with redis connections. Peer verification is a security feature that checks if the host you're connecting to is who it says it is. This is often done by checking a digital certificate.

**Signing & encryption**

This CAS feature is able to accept signing and encryption crypto keys. In most scenarios if keys are not provided, CAS will auto-generate them. The following instructions apply if you wish to manually and beforehand create the signing and encryption keys.

Note that if you are asked to create a [JWK](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) of a certain size for the key, you are to use the following set of commands to generate the token:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apereo/cas/master/etc/jwk-gen.jar
java -jar jwk-gen.jar -t oct -s [size]
```

The outcome would be similar to:

```json
{
  "kty": "oct",
  "kid": "...",
  "k": "..."
}
```

The generated value for `k` needs to be assigned to the relevant CAS settings. Note that keys generated via the above algorithm are processed by CAS using the Advanced Encryption Standard (`AES`) algorithm which is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.

## Indexing & Search

See [this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/ticketing/Redis-Ticket-Registry-RediSearch.html) for more information.

## Caching & Messaging

The Redis ticket registry layers an in-memory cache on top of Redis to assist with performance, particularly when it comes to fetching ticket objects from Redis using `SCAN` or `KEYS` operations that execute pattern matching. This cache is specific and isolated to the CAS server node’s memory, and is able to clean up after itself with a dedicated expiration policy that is constructed off of the ticket’s expiration policy. A ticket is kept in the cache for no longer than 30 seconds, or less if the ticket expires sooner. Each cache inside an individual CAS server node is told about ticket changes made by other CAS server nodes via a message-based mechanism backed by Redis itself, and drops its copy of a ticket that has changed. Note that you can always entirely disable the caching mechanism by forcing its maximum capacity to be at zero via dedicated CAS settings.

The following settings and properties are available from the CAS configuration catalog:

- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.cache.cache-size` (Optional; type `Long`; default `10000`): This cache size specifies the maximum number of entries the cache may contain. Note that the cache may evict an entry before this limit is exceeded or temporarily exceed the threshold while evicting. As the cache size grows close to the maximum, the cache evicts entries that are less likely to be used again. For example, the cache may evict an entry because it hasn't been used recently or very often. Note: to disable the cache, you may choose a cache size of `0`.
- `cas.ticket.registry.redis.cache.initial-capacity` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `1000`): This cache capacity sets the minimum total size for the internal data structures. Providing a large enough estimate at construction time avoids the need for expensive resizing operations later, but setting this value unnecessarily high wastes memory.

### Actuator Endpoints

The following endpoints are provided by CAS:

`redisTicketsCache`

CAS endpoint · 2 operations · Not exposed by default

**GET** `redisTicketsCache/{ticketId}`: Fetch the ticket entity from the Redis first-level in-memory CAS cache. (1 param)

Parameters

| Name | In | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ticketId`required | query | – | The ticket id to fetch |

Response

- **Returns**: `ResponseEntity`
- **Produces**: `application/json`
- **Java method**: `fetchTicket(String)`
- **Defined in**: `RedisTicketRegistryCacheEndpoint`

Example request

```bash
curl -u "casuser:password" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  "https://sso.example.org/cas/actuator/redisTicketsCache/{ticketId}?ticketId=..."
```

**DELETE** `redisTicketsCache/{ticketId}`: Invalidate and remove the provided ticket from the Redis first-level in-memory CAS cache. The ticket entity is not removed from the Redis instance itself. Invalidating the ticket entity will force CAS to re-fetch the ticket from Redis and ignore/discard its own cached copy, if any. (1 param)

Parameters

| Name | In | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ticketId`required | query | – | The ticket id to invalidate |

Response

- **Returns**: `ResponseEntity`
- **Produces**: `application/json`
- **Java method**: `invalidateTicket(String)`
- **Defined in**: `RedisTicketRegistryCacheEndpoint`

Example request

```bash
curl -u "casuser:password" \
  -X DELETE \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  "https://sso.example.org/cas/actuator/redisTicketsCache/{ticketId}?ticketId=..."
```

**Enable & expose**

Turn the endpoint on and expose it over the web. One entry covers every operation. By default only `info`, `health` and `status` are exposed.

```properties
management.endpoint.redisTicketsCache.access=UNRESTRICTED
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=redisTicketsCache
```

Endpoints may be mapped to other paths. For example, to serve `health` at `healthcheck`:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.path-mapping.health=healthcheck
```

**Security**

Once exposed, every call goes through [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security), and CAS decides access per endpoint. Without a rule, the special `defaults` endpoint applies, which denies access.

Who may call it

*Authenticated*

```properties
cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.redisTicketsCache.access=AUTHENTICATED
```

*Role*

```properties
cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.redisTicketsCache.access=ROLE
cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.redisTicketsCache.required-roles=ADMIN
```

*IP address*

```properties
cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.redisTicketsCache.access=IP_ADDRESS
cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.redisTicketsCache.required-ip-addresses=127.0.0.1
```

*Anyone*

```properties
cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.redisTicketsCache.access=PERMIT
```

Where credentials are checked

*Basic*

A single user defined in CAS settings. If the name and password are left undefined, CAS generates them at startup.

- `spring.security.user.name` (Third party; type `String`; default `user`): Default user name.
- `spring.security.user.password` (Third party; type `String`): Password for the default user name.
- `spring.security.user.roles` (Third party; type `List<String>`): Granted roles for the default user name.

*JAAS*

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jaas.login-config` (Optional; type `Resource`): JAAS login resource file.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jaas.login-context-name` (Optional; type `String`): The login context name should coincide with a given index in the login config specified. This name is used as the index to the configuration specified in the login config property. ``` JAASTest { org.springframework.security.authentication.jaas.TestLoginModule required; }; ``` In the above example, `JAASTest` should be set as the context name.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jaas.refresh-configuration-on-startup` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `true`): If set, a call to `Configuration#refresh()` will be made by `#configureJaas(Resource)` method.

*LDAP*

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.base-dn` (Required; type `String`): Base DN to use. There may be scenarios where different parts of a single LDAP tree could be considered as base-dns. Rather than duplicating the LDAP configuration block for each individual base-dn, each entry can be specified and joined together using a special delimiter character. The user DN is retrieved using the combination of all base-dn and DN resolvers in the order defined. DN resolution should fail if multiple DNs are found. Otherwise the first DN found is returned. Usual syntax is: `subtreeA,dc=example,dc=net|subtreeC,dc=example,dc=net`.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.bind-credential` (Required; type `String`): The bind credential to use when connecting to LDAP.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.bind-dn` (Required; type `String`): The bind DN to use when connecting to LDAP. LDAP connection configuration injected into the LDAP connection pool can be initialized with the following parameters: - `bindDn/bindCredential` provided - Use the provided credentials to bind when initializing connections. - `bindDn/bindCredential` set to `*` - Use a fast-bind strategy to initialize the pool. - `bindDn/bindCredential` set to blank - Skip connection initializing; perform operations anonymously. - SASL mechanism provided - Use the given SASL mechanism to bind when initializing connections.

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.search-filter` (Required; type `String`): User filter to use for searching. Syntax is `cn={user}` or `cn={0}`. You may also provide an external groovy script in the syntax of `file:/path/to/GroovyScript.groovy` to fully build the final filter template dynamically.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.type` (Required; type `AbstractLdapAuthenticationProperties.AuthenticationTypes`; default `AUTHENTICATED`): The authentication type. - `AD` - Users authenticate with `sAMAccountName`. - `AUTHENTICATED` - Manager bind/search type of authentication. If {@code} principalAttributePassword} is empty then a user simple bind is done to validate credentials. Otherwise the given attribute is compared with the given `principalAttributePassword` using the `SHA` encrypted value of it. - `ANONYMOUS`: Similar semantics as `AUTHENTICATED` except no `bindDn` and `bindCredential` may be specified to initialize the connection. If `principalAttributePassword` is empty then a user simple bind is done to validate credentials. Otherwise the given attribute is compared with the given `principalAttributePassword` using the `SHA` encrypted value of it. - DIRECT: Direct Bind - Compute user DN from format string and perform simple bind. This is relevant when no search is required to compute the DN needed for a bind operation. Use cases for this type are: 1) All users are under a single branch in the directory, `e.g. ou=Users,dc=example,dc=org.` 2) The username provided on the CAS login form is part of the DN, e.g. `uid=%s,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=org`.

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.block-wait-time` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT3S`): The length of time the pool will block. By default the pool will block indefinitely and there is no guarantee that waiting threads will be serviced in the order in which they made their request. This option should be used with a blocking connection pool when you need to control the exact number of connections that can be created
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.connect-timeout` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT5S`): Sets the maximum amount of time that connects will block.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.connection-strategy` (Optional; type `String`): If multiple URLs are provided as the ldapURL this describes how each URL will be processed. - `ACTIVE_PASSIVE` First LDAP will be used for every request unless it fails and then the next shall be used. - `ROUND_ROBIN` For each new connection the next url in the list will be used. - `RANDOM` For each new connection a random LDAP url will be selected. - `DNS_SRV` LDAP urls based on DNS SRV records of the configured/given LDAP url will be used.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.deref-aliases` (Optional; type `String`): Define how aliases are de-referenced.

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.ldap-authz.group-base-dn` (Optional; type `String`): Base DN to start the search looking for groups.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.ldap-authz.group-filter` (Optional; type `String`): Search filter to begin looking for groups.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.ldap-authz.group-prefix` (Optional; type `String`): A prefix that is prepended to the group attribute value to construct an authorized role.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.ldap-authz.role-attribute` (Optional; type `String`; default `uugid`): Attribute expected to be found on the entry whose value is going to be used to construct roles. The final value is always prefixed with `#rolePrefix`. This is useful in scenarios where you wish to grant access to a resource to all users who carry a special attribute.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.ldap-authz.role-prefix` (Optional; type `String`; default `ROLE_`): Prefix for the role.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.ldap-authz.search-filter` (Optional; type `String`): LDAP search filter to locate accounts.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.max-pool-size` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `10`): Maximum LDAP connection pool size which the pool can use to grow.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.min-pool-size` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `3`): Minimum LDAP connection pool size. Size the pool should be initialized to and pruned to
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.name` (Optional; type `String`): Name of the LDAP handler.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.page-size` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `0`): Request that the server return results in batches of a specific size. See [RFC 2696](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2696.txt). This control is often used to work around server result size limits. A negative/zero value disables paged requests.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.pool-passivator` (Optional; type `String`; default `BIND`): You may receive unexpected LDAP failures, when CAS is configured to authenticate using `DIRECT` or `AUTHENTICATED` types and LDAP is locked down to not allow anonymous binds/searches. Every second attempt with a given LDAP connection from the pool would fail if it was on the same connection as a failed login attempt, and the regular connection validator would similarly fail. When a connection is returned back to a pool, it still may contain the principal and credentials from the previous attempt. Before the next bind attempt using that connection, the validator tries to validate the connection again but fails because it’s no longer trying with the configured bind credentials but with whatever user DN was used in the previous step. Given the validation failure, the connection is closed and CAS would deny access by default. Passivators attempt to reconnect to LDAP with the configured bind credentials, effectively resetting the connection to what it should be after each bind request. Furthermore if you are seeing errors in the logs that resemble a 'Operation exception encountered, reopening connection' type of message, this usually is an indication that the connection pool’s validation timeout established and created by CAS is greater than the timeout configured in the LDAP server, or more likely, in the load balancer in front of the LDAP servers. You can adjust the LDAP server session’s timeout for connections, or you can teach CAS to use a validity period that is equal or less than the LDAP server session’s timeout. Accepted values are: - `NONE`: No passivation takes place. - `BIND`: The default behavior which passivates a connection by performing a bind operation on it. This option requires the availability of bind credentials when establishing connections to LDAP.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.principal-attribute-password` (Optional; type `String`): If principalAttributePassword is empty then a user simple bind is done to validate credentials otherwise the given attribute is compared with the given principalAttributePassword using the SHA encrypted value of it. For the anonymous authentication type, if principalAttributePassword is empty then a user simple bind is done to validate credentials otherwise the given attribute is compared with the given principalAttributePassword using the SHA encrypted value of it.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.prune-period` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT2H`): Removes connections from the pool based on how long they have been idle in the available queue. Run the pruning process at the indicated interval.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.resolve-from-attribute` (Optional; type `String`): If this attribute is set, the value found in the first attribute value will be used in place of the DN.

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.trust-manager` (Optional; type `String`): Trust Manager options. Trust managers are responsible for managing the trust material that is used when making LDAP trust decisions, and for deciding whether credentials presented by a peer should be accepted. Accepted values are: - `DEFAULT`: Enable and force the default JVM trust managers. - `ANY`: Trust any client or server.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.ldap.trust-store` (Optional; type `String`): Path to the keystore used to determine which certificates or certificate authorities should be trusted.

**LDAP & Active Directory**

**LDAP Scriptable Search Filter**

LDAP search filters can point to an external Groovy script to dynamically construct the final filter template.

The script itself may be designed as:

```groovy
import org.ldaptive.*
import org.springframework.context.*

def run(Object[] args) {
    def (filter,parameters,applicationContext,logger) = args

    logger.info("Configuring LDAP filter")
    filter.setFilter("uid=something")
}
```

The following parameters are passed to the script:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `filter` | `FilterTemplate` to be updated by the script and used for the LDAP query. |
| `parameters` | Map of query parameters which may be used to construct the final filter. |
| `applicationContext` | Reference to the Spring `ApplicationContext` reference. |
| `logger` | The object responsible for issuing log messages such as `logger.info(...)`. |

To prepare CAS to support and integrate with Apache Groovy, please [review this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development//integration/Apache-Groovy-Scripting.html).

*JDBC*

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.driver-class` (Required; type `String`; default `org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver`): The JDBC driver used to connect to the database.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.password` (Required; type `String`): The database connection password.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.password-encoder.encoding-algorithm` (Required; type `String`): The encoding algorithm to use such as `MD5`. Relevant when the type used is `DEFAULT` or `GLIBC_CRYPT`. When used with `PasswordEncoderTypes#PBKDF2`, it should be one of `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1`, `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256` or `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512`.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.password-encoder.type` (Required; type `String`; default `NONE`): Define the password encoder type to use. Type may be specified as blank or `NONE` to disable password encoding. It may also refer to a fully-qualified class name that implements the Spring Security's `PasswordEncoder` interface if you wish you define your own encoder. The following types may be used: - `NONE`: No password encoding (i.e. plain-text) takes place. - `DEFAULT`: Use the `DefaultPasswordEncoder` of CAS. For message-digest algorithms via `character-encoding` and `encoding-algorithm`. - `BCRYPT`: Use the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` based on the strength provided and an optional secret. - `SCRYPT`: Use the `SCryptPasswordEncoder`. - `PBKDF2`: Use the `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` based on the strength provided and an optional secret. - `STANDARD`: Use the `StandardPasswordEncoder` based on the secret provided. - `SSHA`: Use the `LdapShaPasswordEncoder` supports Ldap SHA and SSHA (salted-SHA). The values are base-64 encoded and have the label {SHA} or {SSHA} prepended to the encoded hash. - `GLIBC_CRYPT`: Use the `GlibcCryptPasswordEncoder` based on the `encoding-algorithm`, strength provided and an optional secret. - `org.example.MyEncoder`: An implementation of `PasswordEncoder` of your own choosing. - `file:///path/to/script.groovy`: Path to a Groovy script charged with handling password encoding operations.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.url` (Required; type `String`; default `jdbc:hsqldb:mem:cas-hsql-database`): The database connection URL.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.user` (Required; type `String`; default `sa`): The database user. The database user must have sufficient permissions to be able to handle schema changes and updates, when needed.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.autocommit` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): The default auto-commit behavior of connections in the pool. Determined whether queries such as update/insert should be immediately executed without waiting for an underlying transaction.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.batch-size` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `100`): A non-zero value enables use of JDBC2 batch updates by Hibernate. e.g. recommended values between 5 and 30.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.connection-timeout` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT30S`): Indicates the maximum number of milliseconds that the service can wait to obtain a connection.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.data-source-name` (Optional; type `String`): Attempts to do a JNDI data source look up for the data source name specified. Will attempt to locate the data source object as is.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.ddl-auto` (Optional; type `String`; default `update`): Hibernate feature to automatically validate and exports DDL to the schema. By default, creates and drops the schema automatically when a session is starts and ends. Setting the value to `validate` or `none` may be more desirable for production, but any of the following options can be used: - `validate`: Validate the schema, but make no changes to the database. - `update`: Update the schema. - `create`: Create the schema, destroying previous data. - `create-drop`: Drop the schema at the end of the session. - `none`: Do nothing. Note that during a version migration where any schema has changed `create-drop` will result in the loss of all data as soon as CAS is started. For transient data like tickets this is probably not an issue, but in cases like the audit table important data could be lost. Using `update`, while safe for data, is confirmed to result in invalid database state. `validate` or `none` settings are likely the only safe options for production use. For more info, [see this](http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api).
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.default-catalog` (Optional; type `String`): Qualifies unqualified table names with the given catalog in generated SQL.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.default-schema` (Optional; type `String`): Qualify unqualified table names with the given schema/tablespace in generated SQL.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.dialect` (Optional; type `String`; default `org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect`): The database dialect is a configuration setting for platform independent software (JPA, Hibernate, etc) which allows such software to translate its generic SQL statements into vendor specific DDL, DML.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.fail-fast-timeout` (Optional; type `Long`; default `1`): Set the pool initialization failure timeout. - Any value greater than zero will be treated as a timeout for pool initialization. The calling thread will be blocked from continuing until a successful connection to the database, or until the timeout is reached. If the timeout is reached, then a `PoolInitializationException` will be thrown. - A value of zero will *not* prevent the pool from starting in the case that a connection cannot be obtained. However, upon start the pool will attempt to obtain a connection and validate that the `connectionTestQuery` and `connectionInitSql` are valid. If those validations fail, an exception will be thrown. If a connection cannot be obtained, the validation is skipped and the pool will start and continue to try to obtain connections in the background. This can mean that callers to `DataSource#getConnection()` may encounter exceptions. - A value less than zero will *not* bypass any connection attempt and validation during startup, and therefore the pool will start immediately. The pool will continue to try to obtain connections in the background. This can mean that callers to `DataSource#getConnection()` may encounter exceptions. Note that if this timeout value is greater than or equal to zero (0), and therefore an initial connection validation is performed, this timeout does not override the `connectionTimeout` or `validationTimeout`; they will be honored before this timeout is applied. The default value is one millisecond.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.fetch-size` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `100`): Used to specify number of rows to be fetched in a select query.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.generate-statistics` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Allow hibernate to generate query statistics.

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.idle-timeout` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT10M`): Controls the maximum amount of time that a connection is allowed to sit idle in the pool.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.isolate-internal-queries` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): This property determines whether data source isolates internal pool queries, such as the connection alive test, in their own transaction. Since these are typically read-only queries, it is rarely necessary to encapsulate them in their own transaction. This property only applies if `#autocommit` is disabled.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.isolation-level-name` (Optional; type `String`; default `ISOLATION_READ_COMMITTED`): Defines the isolation level for transactions. @see org.springframework.transaction.TransactionDefinition
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.leak-threshold` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT6S`): Controls the amount of time that a connection can be out of the pool before a message is logged indicating a possible connection leak.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.password-encoder.character-encoding` (Optional; type `String`; default `UTF-8`): The encoding algorithm to use such as 'UTF-8'. Relevant when the type used is `DEFAULT`.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.password-encoder.hash-length` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `16`): When used by `PasswordEncoderTypes#ARGON2`, it indicates the hash strength/length.

Usually relevant when dealing with `PasswordEncoderTypes#BCRYPT`, `PasswordEncoderTypes#PBKDF2` or `PasswordEncoderTypes#GLIBC_CRYPT`. When used by `PasswordEncoderTypes#ARGON2` or `PasswordEncoderTypes#PBKDF2`, it indicates the salt strength.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.physical-naming-strategy-class-name` (Optional; type `String`; default `org.apereo.cas.hibernate.CasHibernatePhysicalNamingStrategy`): Fully-qualified name of the class that can control the physical naming strategy of hibernate.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.keep-alive-time` (Optional; type `String`; default `0`): This property controls the keepalive interval for a connection in the pool. An in-use connection will never be tested by the keepalive thread, only when it is idle will it be tested. Default is zero, which disables this feature.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.max-size` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `18`): Controls the maximum number of connections to keep in the pool, including both idle and in-use connections.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.max-wait` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT2S`): Sets the maximum time in seconds that this data source will wait while attempting to connect to a database. A value of zero specifies that the timeout is the default system timeout if there is one; otherwise, it specifies that there is no timeout.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.maximum-lifetime` (Optional; type `String`; default `PT10M`): This property controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool. When a connection reaches this timeout, even if recently used, it will be retired from the pool. An in-use connection will never be retired, only when it is idle will it be removed.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.min-size` (Optional; type `Integer`; default `6`): Controls the minimum size that the pool is allowed to reach, including both idle and in-use connections.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.name` (Optional; type `String`): Set the name of the connection pool. This is primarily used for the MBean to uniquely identify the pool configuration.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.suspension` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Whether or not pool suspension is allowed. There is a performance impact when pool suspension is enabled. Unless you need it (for a redundancy system for example) do not enable it.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.pool.timeout-millis` (Optional; type `Long`; default `1000`): The maximum number of milliseconds that the pool will wait for a connection to be validated as alive.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.propagation-behavior-name` (Optional; type `String`; default `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED`): Defines the propagation behavior for transactions. @see org.springframework.transaction.TransactionDefinition
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.properties` (Optional; type `Map<String,String>`): Additional settings provided by Hibernate (or the connection provider) in form of key-value pairs.
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.query` (Optional; type `String`): Query to execute in order to authenticate users via JDBC. Example: `SELECT username,password,enabled FROM users WHERE username=?`
- `cas.monitor.endpoints.jdbc.read-only` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Configures the Connections to be added to the pool as read-only Connections.

Control global properties that are relevant to Hibernate, when CAS attempts to employ and utilize database resources, connections and queries.

- `cas.jdbc.gen-ddl` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `true`): Whether to generate DDL after the EntityManagerFactory has been initialized creating/updating all relevant tables.
- `cas.jdbc.physical-table-names` (Optional; type `Map<String,String>`): Indicate a physical table name to be used by the hibernate naming strategy in case table names need to be customized for the specific type of database. The key here indicates the CAS-provided table name and the value is the translate physical name for the database. If a match is not found for the CAS-provided table name, then that name will be used by default.
- `cas.jdbc.show-sql` (Optional; type `Boolean`; default `false`): Whether SQL queries should be displayed in the console/logs.

**Password encoding**

If you need to design your own password encoding scheme where the type is specified as a fully qualified Java class name, the structure of the class would be similar to the following:

```java
package org.example.cas;

import org.springframework.security.crypto.codec.*;
import org.springframework.security.crypto.password.*;

public class MyEncoder extends AbstractPasswordEncoder {
    @Override
    protected byte[] encode(CharSequence rawPassword, byte[] salt) {
        return ...
    }
}
```

If you need to design your own password encoding scheme where the type is specified as a path to a Groovy script, the structure of the script would be similar to the following:

```groovy
import java.util.*

byte[] run(final Object... args) {
    def (rawPassword,generatedSalt,logger,applicationContext) = args
    logger.debug("Encoding password...")
    return ...
}

Boolean matches(final Object... args) {
    def (rawPassword,encodedPassword,logger,applicationContext) = args
    logger.debug("Does match or not ?");
    return ...
```

To prepare CAS to support and integrate with Apache Groovy, please [review this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development//integration/Apache-Groovy-Scripting.html).

*JSON*

A static list of users, passwords and roles in a JSON file. Supported password encodings are `{sha512}`, `{sha256}`, `{bcrypt}`, `{noop}`, `{pbkdf2}`, `{scrypt}` and `{argon2}`.

```json
[
    {
        "username": "casuser",
        "password": "{sha512}<hashed-password>",
        "authorities": [ "ROLE_ADMIN" ]
    }
]
```

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.json.location` (Required; type `Resource`): The location of the resource. Resources can be URLs, or files found either on the classpath or outside somewhere in the file system. In the event the configured resource is a Groovy script, especially if the script is set to reload on changes, you may need to adjust the total number of `inotify` instances. On Linux, you may need to add the following line to `/etc/sysctl.conf`: `fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 256`. You can check the current value via `cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances`. In situations and scenarios where CAS is able to automatically watch the underlying resource for changes and detect updates and modifications dynamically, you may be able to specify the following setting as either an environment variable or system property with a value of `false` to disable the resource watcher: `org.apereo.cas.util.io.PathWatcherService`.

**Settings**

- `cas.monitor.endpoints.endpoint.redisTicketsCache.access` (Optional; type `ActuatorEndpointProperties.EndpointAccessLevel`; default `DENY`): Define the security access level of the endpoint.

**Troubleshooting**

- `404`: the endpoint is not enabled or not exposed; check the *Enable & expose* tab.
- `401` or `403`: the access rule or the credentials rejected the call; check the *Security* tab.

### Design & Performance

The Redis ticket registry treats Redis as the shared source of truth for CAS tickets, while each CAS node may keep a local in-memory cache as a first-level optimization. The local cache is per-node and is intended to reduce Redis reads and ticket deserialization for hot tickets. It should not be treated as authoritative. Ticket lookups may be served from the local cache, but ticket lifecycle operations still need to keep Redis and all node-local caches coherent.

Cache keys are derived from the Redis ticket key format, not simply from the clear ticket id in all cases. This matters when registry cryptography is enabled. In that mode, ticket identifiers and principal identifiers are digested before being used in Redis keys, so the local cache key for a ticket is also the digested form. Any cache invalidation mechanism must use the same canonical cache key that the registry uses for reads and writes. Invalidating by the clear ticket id will miss encrypted/digested cache entries and can leave stale tickets alive on other nodes.

Cluster cache coherence is handled through Redis-backed pub/sub messages. When one CAS node adds, updates, deletes, or clears tickets, it publishes a notification. Other CAS nodes receive that notification and invalidate their local cache; the ticket is read from Redis again when it is next needed. Nodes ignore their own messages because the local registry operation has already updated the local cache directly. Notifications never carry the ticket object; they only carry enough information to identify the local cache entry, such as the Redis key or derived cache key. Tickets therefore do not travel over the pub/sub channel, unencrypted or otherwise, and a change does not cost every node a deserialization.

Pub/sub messages are not delivered again to a node that missed them while disconnected, which is why cached tickets are only kept for a short time. A ticket read from Redis while another node announces a change to it is not kept either, so a session ended on one node is not kept alive by the cache of another.

From a performance perspective, the important distinction is between operations that need the ticket body and operations that only need to remove state. Delete messages should avoid materializing the ticket when the registry already knows the Redis key being removed. Bulk user/session deletion paths are especially sensitive: scanning Redis, fetching each ticket, deserializing it, and decrypting it just to publish a cache invalidation can be very expensive. For this reason, the registry keeps a per-user index of ticket keys, a sorted set under `CAS_PRINCIPAL_TICKETS:` scored by each ticket’s expiration and updated in the same pipelined batch that writes the ticket. Removing all tickets of a user reads that index, unlinks the listed keys in batches, invalidates the local cache by canonical key and publishes delete notifications by key, so its cost depends on that user’s tickets and not on the size of the registry. The index expires with the user’s longest-lived ticket, and entries of expired tickets are dropped as new tickets are written.

There are several operational caveats. Redis pub/sub is not durable; a node that is down, disconnected, or misconfigured when a message is published can miss the notification and retain stale local cache entries until expiration or manual cache clearing. CAS node queue identifiers must be unique per node, or left unset so they are generated uniquely; if multiple nodes share the same identifier, they may incorrectly treat each other’s notifications as self-published messages and ignore them. Administrative logout cannot remove a user’s browser cookie directly, so correctness depends on the server-side ticket deletion being authoritative across Redis and all local caches. For highly conservative deployments, disabling the local cache or setting its size to zero trades performance for simpler consistency semantics.

## Eviction Policy

Redis manages the internal eviction policy of cached objects via its time-alive settings. The timeout is the ticket’s `timeToLive` value. So you need to ensure the cache is alive long enough to support the individual expiration policy of tickets, and let CAS clean the tickets as part of its own cleaner if necessary.

Redis removes expired keys in two ways. Passive expiration happens when CAS accesses a key and Redis notices that its TTL has elapsed; the key is deleted before the command proceeds. Active expiration runs periodically in the background: Redis samples keys that have TTLs, deletes the ones that are already expired, and repeats this work within a CPU-time budget. This means expired keys are usually removed quickly, but deletion is not a continuous full scan of the keyspace.

## Ticket Registry Locking

This ticket registry implementation automatically supports [distributed locking](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/ticketing/Ticket-Registry-Locking.html). The schemas and structures that track locking operations should be automatically created by CAS using [Spring Integration](https://spring.io/projects/spring-integration) Redis support.
