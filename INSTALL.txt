JA-SIG Central Authentication Service
Quick Installation Guide
----------------------------------

This guide is meant to be a quickstart for you configure and install CAS 
as quickly and easily as possible.  If you need more information, 
you can check the CAS website at 

http://www.ja-sig.org/products/cas/

and you can subscribe to the CAS mailing list by visiting:

http://tp.its.yale.edu/mailman/listinfo/cas

Quick Demo
----------

The following steps will deploy the included demo of CAS.  Start here if
you're new to CAS and want to see it in action.  These steps assume
you will be using Tomcat as your servlet container.

1. copy target/cas.war to Tomcat's webapps/ directory

2. start Tomcat

3. access the CAS login page by opening up a web browser and visiting:

   http://hostname:8080/cas/login (see note below)

   You should see the CAS login page asking you for your username and
   password.  The default authentication plugin accepts NetID=password.
   Enter in an identical value for NetID and password and click LOGIN.
   If everything is set up correctly, you should see a page stating that
   you've successfully logged into CAS.  Congratulations!

   Note: this URL assumes that port 8080 is not blocked by a firewall,
   and Tomcat is configured to listen on that port (it is by default).
   Since we are only testing CAS, this configuration uses http for transport 
   rather than https -- this is not something you would do in production.

Customization
-------------

After you've gotten CAS working, one of the first things you will want 
to do is create your own skin.

There are two skins included with CAS.  One is called "default" and the 
other is called "simple".  "simple" is meant to be used as a template for
building your own skin.  If you look in webapp/WEB-INF/view/jsp/simple/ui, 
you will see that a skin is made up of the following files:

casConfirmView.jsp      displayed when the user is warned before being
                        redirected to the service
casGenericSuccess.jsp   displayed when the user has been logged in without
                        providing a service to be redirected to
casLoginView.jsp        the login form itself
casLogoutView.jsp       displayed when the user has been logged out
serviceErrorView.jsp    used in conjunction with the service registry feature,
                        displayed when the service the user is trying to 
                        access is not allowed to use CAS.  Note that this
                        feature is not enabled by default, in which case
                        all services are able to use CAS.

Steps for creating a custom skin
--------------------------------

1. copy the contents of webapp/WEB-INF/view/jsp/simple/ui into
   webapp/WEB-INF/view/jsp/default/ui (backup this directory first if
   you want to save the default pages that come with CAS).

2. edit each of the pages to appear as you want them.  Take care when 
   you're editing these pages not to change any of the forms or logic tags
   unless you're sure you know what you're doing.  If you need to include 
   a css file, put it in webapp/themes/default/cas.css and reference it 
   with the following link tag:

   <link rel="stylesheet" href="<spring:theme code="css" />" type="text/css" 
    media="all" />

   The "<spring:theme code="css" />" will be replaced with the appropriate 
   URL to that directory.

Custom Plugins & Building
-------------------------

3. The remaining steps for building CAS can be found in 
   localPlugins/README.txt.  Please view this file to finish your 
   CAS installation.
