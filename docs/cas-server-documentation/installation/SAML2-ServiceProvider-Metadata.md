# SAML2 Service Provider Metadata

This document describes how SAML2 service providers registered with CAS can control their certain aspects of their metadata management.

## Actuator Endpoints

The following endpoints are provided by CAS:

## Metadata Aggregates

CAS services are fundamentally recognized and loaded by service identifiers taught to CAS typically via
regular expressions. This allows for common groupings of applications and services by url patterns (i.e. "Everything that belongs to `example.org` is registered with CAS).
With aggregated metadata, CAS essentially does double authorization checks because it will first attempt to find the entity id
in its collection of resolved metadata components and then it looks to see if that entity id is authorized via the pattern that is assigned to
that service definition. This means you can do one of several things:

1. Open up the pattern to allow everything that is authorized in the metadata.
2. Restrict the pattern to only a select few entity ids found in the
   metadata. This is essentially the same thing as defining metadata criteria
   to filter down the list of resolved relying parties and entity ids except that its done
   after the fact once the metadata is fully loaded and parsed.
3. You can also instruct CAS to filter metadata
   entities by a defined criteria at resolution time when it reads the
   metadata itself. This is essentially the same thing as forcing the pattern
   to match entity ids, except that it's done while CAS is reading the
   metadata and thus load times are improved.

## Metadata Caching & Resolution

Service provider metadata is fetched and loaded on demand for every service and then cached in a global cache for a
configurable duration. Subsequent requests for service metadata will always consult the cache first and if missed,
will resort to actually resolving the metadata by loading or contacting the configured resource.

Each service provider definition that is registered with CAS may optionally also specifically an expiration period of
metadata resolution to override the default global value.

The expiration policy of the service metadata is controlled using the following order:

1. `CacheDuration` setting found inside the SAML2 service provider metadata, if any.
2. Metadata expiration policy and duration defined for the SAML2 registered service defined with CAS.
3. Global metadata expiration policy controlled via CAS settings.

<div class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Metadata Cache</strong><p>
Note that the state of the cache belongs to the CAS server node's own memory and will not distributed in case you have multiple CAS server nodes in a cluster. 
In an HA clustered environment, you would need to bypass load balancers, etc to reach the actual CAS server node(s) before the cache can be accessed.
Otherwise, you run the risk of manipulating and interacting with the metadata cache managed by one CAS server where metadata caches changes would be 
unseen by other CAS servers, until and unless their own cached entries are either forcefully removed or expire.
</p></div>

## Metadata Storage

SAML2 service providers that are registered with CAS can be configured to present their metadata using the following options.

### Default
        
If the SAML2 service provider is able to produce valid metadata, you may register the metadata with CAS as either a URL 
or a path to the metadata XML file or a classpath resource noted by the appropriate prefix. Using this model, CAS will 
consume the metadata directly from a published URL and/or XML file on disk, and may optionally be allowed to verify 
the signature of the metadata as necessary.

Metadata location can use the [Spring Expression Language](../configuration/Configuration-Spring-Expressions.html) syntax.

{% tabs metadata %}

{% tab metadata <i class="fa fa-globe px-1"></i> URL %}

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.support.saml.services.SamlRegisteredService",
  "serviceId" : "the-entity-id-of-the-sp",
  "name" : "SAMLService",
  "id" : 1,
  "metadataLocation" : "https://url/to/metadata.xml"
}
```

Multiple locations may be comma-separated. CAS may attempt to reuse the metadata from a previously-downloaded backup file on disk if the metadata file is still seen as valid. 
This capability will require the forceful fetching of the metadata over HTTP to be disabled.

<div class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Usage</strong>
<p>
SAML2 metadata should generally be signed for integrity and authenticity, especially if itâ€™s provided and shared with 
participants using a URL. Participants and consumers are strongly encouraged to verify the XML signature on the metadata 
file before use; failure to do so will seriously compromise the security of the SAML deployment. A trusted metadata process <strong>MUST</strong> 
verify the XML signature of the metadata. It is not sufficient to request the metadata via a TLS-protected HTTP connection.
</p>
</div>

{% include_cached casproperties.html properties="cas.authn.saml-idp.metadata.http" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab metadata <i class="fa fa-file px-1"></i>File %}
    
Metadata files for SAML2 service providers can be found on the file system directly: 

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.support.saml.services.SamlRegisteredService",
  "serviceId" : "the-entity-id-of-the-sp",
  "name" : "SAMLService",
  "id" : 1,
  "metadataLocation" : "/path/to/metadata.xml"
}
```

Multiple locations may be comma-separated.

{% endtab %}

{% tab metadata <i class="fa fa-folder px-1"></i>Directory %}

This option fetches metadata from a local directory source as needed. You are responsible 
for populating the directory with metadata files, which may be done while CAS is running. 
New metadata will be seen automatically the first time it is requested.

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.support.saml.services.SamlRegisteredService",
  "serviceId" : ".+",
  "name" : "SAMLService",
  "id" : 1,
  "metadataLocation" : "/path/to/metadata/directory"
}
```

Metadata files in the specified directory location must be stored as the lower case 
hex-encoded SHA-1 digest of the service provider entity id suffixed with `.xml`. For example, a service provider
with the entity id `sp1:example` should be stored in as `3494744350abe1fd8efa68c5e2696dbbdca4c33a.xml`. 

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

### Dynamic Metadata

If the SP you wish to integrate with does not produce SAML metadata, you may be able to
use [this service](https://www.samltool.com/sp_metadata.php) to create the metadata,
save it in an XML file and then reference and register it with CAS for the SP.

Alternatively, you may take advantage of a standalone `saml-sp-metadata.json` file that may be found in the same directory
as the CAS metadata artifacts. The contents of this file, may be defined with a rather [relaxed JSON syntax](https://hjson.github.io), 
and may be as follows:

```json
{
  "https://example.org/saml": {
    "entityId": "https://example.org/saml",
    "certificate": "MIIDUj...",
    "assertionConsumerServiceUrl": "https://example.org/sso/",
    "binding": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"
  }
}
```

Each entry in the file is identified by the service provider entity id, allowing CAS to dynamically locate and build the required metadata on the fly
to resume the authentication flow. This may prove easier for those service providers that only present a URL and a signing certificate for the
integration relieving you from creating and managing XML metadata files separately.

The service providers are registered with the CAS service registry as such:

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.support.saml.services.SamlRegisteredService",
  "serviceId" : "https://example.org/saml",
  "name" : "SAMLService",
  "id" : 10000003,
  "metadataLocation" : "json://"
}
```

<div class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Metadata Location</strong><p>The metadata location 
in the registration record above needs to be specified as <code>json://</code> to signal 
to CAS that SAML metadata for registered service provider must be fetched from the designated JSON file.</p></div>
