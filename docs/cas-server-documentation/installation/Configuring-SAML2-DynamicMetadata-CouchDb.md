# CouchDb - SAML2 Metadata Management

Metadata documents may also be stored in and fetched from a NoSQL database. This may specially be used to avoid
copying metadata files across CAS nodes in a cluster, particularly where one needs to deal with more than a
few bilateral SAML integrations. Metadata documents are stored in and fetched from a single pre-defined
table  (i.e. `SamlMetadataDocument`) whose connection information is taught to CAS via settings and
is automatically generated.  The outline of the database document is as follows:

| Field                     | Description
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------
| `id`                          | The identifier of the record.
| `name`             | Indexed field which describes and names the metadata briefly.
| `value`              | The XML document representing the metadata for the service provider.
| `signature`              | The contents of the signing certificate to validate metadata, if any.

Support is enabled by including the following module in the overlay:

{% include casmodule.html group="org.apereo.cas" module="cas-server-support-saml-idp-metadata-couchdb" %}

SAML service definitions must then be designed as follows to allow CAS to fetch metadata documents from CouchDb instances:

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.support.saml.services.SamlRegisteredService",
  "serviceId" : "the-entity-id-of-the-sp",
  "name" : "SAMLService",
  "id" : 10000003,
  "description" : "A relational-db-based metadata resolver",
  "metadataLocation" : "couchdb://",
}
```

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Metadata Location</strong><p>
The metadata location in the registration record above needs to be specified as <code>couchdb://</code> 
to signal to CAS that SAML metadata for registered service provider must be fetched from CouchDb as defined in CAS configuration.
</p></div>

{% include casproperties.html properties="cas.authn.saml-idp.metadata.couch-db" %}

## Identity Provider Metadata

Metadata artifacts that belong to CAS as a SAML2 identity provider may also be managed
and stored via CouchDb. Artifacts such as the metadata, signing and encryption keys, etc are kept
inside a database with documents that would have the following structure:

| Field                     | Description
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
| `id`                      | The identifier of the record.
| `signingCertificate`      | The signing certificate.
| `signingKey`              | The signing key.
| `encryptionCertificate`   | The encryption certificate.
| `encryptionKey`           | The encryption key.
| `metadata`                | The SAML2 identity provider metadata.
| `appliesTo`               | The owner of the SAML2 identity provider metadata (i.e. `CAS`).

## Per Service

Identity provider metadata, certificates and keys can also be defined on a per-service basis to override the global defaults.
Metadata documents that would be applicable to a service definition need to adjust the `appliesTo` field in the metadata
document to carry the service definition's name and numeric identifier using the `[service-name]_[service-numeric-identifier]` format.
