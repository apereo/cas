# Admin Console & Dashboard
   
CAS provides a number of facilities and dashboard that can be used to administer and manage the CAS server deployment.
Such options usually are not mutually exclusive and are designed to work together and present various aspects
of the CAS configuration and build that might include application registrations, configuration properties, etc.

{% tabs casadminoptions %}

{% tab casadminoptions Palantir %}
   
Palantir is the next generation of the [CAS Management](https://github.com/apereo/cas-management) tool. It is now part of the 
CAS codebase in an attempt to both streamline the development and release processes and to ensure the tool
remains consistent and up to date. Its intention is to act as the overall admin management tool and console for the CAS server,
and presents a user interface to allow one to add and modify application registrations, observe CAS server status, 
state of single sign-on sessions and more.

Support is enabled by adding the following module into the overlay:

{% include_cached casmodule.html group="org.apereo.cas" module="cas-server-support-palantir" %}

<div class="alert alert-warning">:warning: <strong>Usage Warning!</strong><p>
This capability is a work in progress. We encourage you to start to experiment and test your CAS deployment 
with this feature and contribute fixes.</p></div>

{% endtab %}

Palantir access will by default require a form-based user authentication. The credentials
used to access this feature are those presented by Spring Security configuration:

{% include_cached casproperties.html thirdPartyStartsWith="spring.security.user" %}

{% tab casadminoptions Spring Boot Admin %}

CAS takes advantage of Spring Boot Admin server to manage and monitor its internal state visually. As a Spring Boot Admin client, CAS registers 
itself with the Spring Boot Admin server over HTTP and reports back its status and health to the serverâ€™s web interface.
     
More details about this integration is [available here](../monitoring/Configuring-SpringBootAdmin.html).
