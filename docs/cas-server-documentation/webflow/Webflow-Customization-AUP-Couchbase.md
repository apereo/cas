# Couchbase Acceptable Usage Policy

CAS can be configured to use a Couchbase instance as the storage mechanism. Upon accepting the policy, the
decision is kept inside a document with a `username` column and the AUP attribute name with the result of the decision.

Support is enabled by including the following dependency in the WAR overlay:

{% include casmodule.html group="org.apereo.cas" module="cas-server-support-aup-couchbase" %}

{% include casproperties.html properties="cas.acceptable-usage-policy.couchbase" %}
