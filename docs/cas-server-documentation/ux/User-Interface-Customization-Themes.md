# Themes - User Interface Customization

With the introduction of [Service Management application](../services/Service-Management.html), deployers 
are now able to switch the themes based on different services. For example, you may want to 
have different login screens (different styles) for staff applications and student applications, or you want to show two 
layouts for day time and night time. This document could help you go through the basic settings to achieve this.
