# Hazelcast Ticket Registry - Azure Auto Discovery

Hazelcast support in CAS may handle auto-discovery automatically via Microsoft Azure. The discovery strategy will provide all Hazelcast instances by 
returning VMs within your Azure resource group that are tagged with a specified value. You will need to setup Azure Active Directory Service Principal credentials for
your Azure Subscription for this plugin to work. With every Hazelcast Virtual Machine you deploy in your resource group, you need to ensure that each VM is
tagged with the value of `clusterId` defined in the CAS Hazelcast configuration. The only requirement is that every VM can access each other either by 
private or public IP address.
