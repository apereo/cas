# CAS Enterprise Single Sign-On

Welcome to the home of the Apereo Central Authentication Service project, more commonly referred to as CAS. CAS is an enterprise 
multilingual single sign-on solution for the web and attempts to be a comprehensive platform for your authentication 
and authorization needs.

CAS is an open and well-documented authentication protocol. The primary implementation of the protocol is 
an open-source Java server component by the same name hosted here, with support for a plethora of 
additional authentication protocols and features.

The following items include a summary of features and technologies presented by the CAS project:

* [Spring Webflow](webflow/Webflow-Customization.html)/Spring Boot [Java server component](planning/Architecture.html).
