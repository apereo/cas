#  SAML2 Delegated Authentication - Identity Provider Discovery Service

<div class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note</strong><p>Using identity provider discovery requires 
delegated authentication to be available. This feature cannot be used on its own
as a standalone discovery service.</p></div>

{% include_cached casmodule.html group="org.apereo.cas" module="cas-server-support-saml-idp-discovery" %}

Identity provider discovery allows CAS 
to [embed and present a discovery service](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/EDS10/Embedded+Discovery+Service) 
as part of delegated authentication. Configured SAML2 identity providers in the CAS configuration
used for delegated authentication are presented as options for discovery. 

CAS is also able to directly consume multiple JSON feeds
that contain discovery metadata about available identity providers. The discovery JSON feed 
may be fetched from a URL (i.e. exposed by a Shibboleth Service Provider) or it may
directly be consumed as a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
[{
 "entityID": "https://idp.example.net/idp/saml",
 "DisplayNames": [{
  "value": "Example.net",
  "lang": "en"
  }],
 "Descriptions": [{
  "value": "An identity provider for the people, by the people.",
  "lang": "en"
  }],
 "Logos": [{
  "value": "https://example.net/images/logo.png",
  "height": "90",
  "width": "62"
  }]
}]
```

The following endpoints are available:

| Endpoint                  | Description                                                              |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/idp/discovery`          | Identity provider discovery landing page.                                |
| `/idp/discovery/feed`     | Identity provider discovery JSON feed.                                   |
| `/idp/discovery/redirect` | Return endpoint to let CAS invoke the identity provider after selection. |

Applications may directly invoke the discovery service via `[cas-server-prefix]/idp/discovery`. The discovery service may also 
be invoked using the discovery protocol via `[cas-server-prefix]/idp/discovery?entityID=[service-provider-entity-id]&return=[cas-server-prefix]/idp/discovery/redirect`. 
Additional parameters may be included as part of the `return` url and they all must be encoded.
