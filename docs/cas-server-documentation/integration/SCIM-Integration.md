# Overview

The [SCIM standard](http://www.simplecloud.info/) is created to simplify user management and provisioning in the cloud by
defining a schema for representing users and groups and a REST API for all the necessary CRUD operations. SCIM 
integrations with CAS allow deployers to auto-provision the authenticated CAS principal to a SCIM server/target 
with additional support to map principal attributes into the appropriate claims and properties of the user resource.

SCIM versions 1.1 and 2 are both supported, thanks to the SDK provided by [UnboundID](https://github.com/PingIdentity).

Typical use case for enabling SCIM is to synchronize and provision user accounts, just in time, 
to services and applications that are integrated with CAS for single sign-on. In cases where 
the application also has its own account store, a mapping of user accounts between 
the CAS canonical account store (LDAP, JDBC, etc) and the application may be required. To 
accommodate this issue, CAS may be allowed to provision the authenticated principal 
via SCIM to a provisioning/identity/entity engine which would then dynamically synchronize user profiles to target systems.

## Configuration

Support is enabled by including the following dependency in the WAR overlay:

{% include casmodule.html group="org.apereo.cas" module="cas-server-support-scim" %}

{% include casproperties.html properties="cas.scim" %}

## Per Application

SCIM relevant settings can be specified per application in form of service properties. The
following properties are supported:

| Property          | Description
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| `scimOAuthToken`  | OAuth token to use for authenticated requests.
| `scimUsername`    | Username to use for authenticated requests.
| `scimPassword`    | Password to use for authenticated requests.
| `scimTarget`      | SCIM target to use for provisioning.
 
A sample JSON file follows:

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.RegexRegisteredService",
  "serviceId" : "^https://.+",
  "name" : "sample service",
  "id" : 100,
  "properties" : {
    "@class" : "java.util.HashMap",
    "scimUsername" : {
      "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.DefaultRegisteredServiceProperty",
      "values" : [ "java.util.HashSet", [ "username" ] ]
    },
    "scimPassword" : {
      "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.DefaultRegisteredServiceProperty",
      "values" : [ "java.util.HashSet", [ "p@$$w0rd" ] ]
    }
  }
}
```
