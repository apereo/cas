# Delegated Authentication - Identity Provider Registration

An identity provider is a server which can authenticate users (like Google, Yahoo...) instead of a CAS server.
If you want to delegate the CAS authentication to Twitter for example, you have to add an
OAuth client for the Twitter provider, which will be done automatically for you once provider settings are taught to CAS.

Notice that for each provider, the CAS server is considered as a client and therefore should be declared as
an client at the external identity provider. After the declaration, a key and a secret may be given by the provider which has
to be defined in the CAS configuration as well.

## Actuator Endpoints

The following endpoints are provided by CAS:

{% include_cached actuators.html endpoints="delegatedClients" %}

## Default

{% assign providers = "DropBox,Facebook,FourSquare,Google,HiOrgServer,PayPal,Twitter,WindowsLive,Wordpress,Yahoo,CAS,LinkedIn,GitHub,OAuth20,Google-OpenID-Connect,SAML,Keycloak,Azure-AD,Apple,Generic-OpenID-Connect" | split: "," | sort %}

Identity providers for delegated authentication can be registered with CAS using settings. 

<table class="cas-datatable">
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Provider</th><th>Reference</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for provider in providers %}
    <tr>
    <td>{{ provider | replace: "-", " " }} </td>
    <td><a href="Delegate-Authentication-{{ provider }}.html">See this guide</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>

## REST

Identity providers for delegated authentication can be provided to CAS using an external REST endpoint. 

{% include_cached casproperties.html properties="cas.authn.pac4j.rest" %}

The expected payload *type*, that is controlled via CAS settings, can be understood and consumed in the following ways.

{% tabs clientpayloads %}

{% tab clientpayloads Pac4j %}

This allows the CAS server to reach to a remote REST endpoint whose responsibility is to produce the following payload in the response body:

```json
{
    "callbackUrl": "https://sso.example.org/cas/login",
    "properties": {
        "github.id": "...",
        "github.secret": "...",
        
        "cas.loginUrl.1": "...",
        "cas.protocol.1": "..."
    }
}
```

The syntax and collection of available `properties` in the above payload is controlled by the [Pac4j library](https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j).
The response that is returned must be accompanied by a `200` status code.

{% endtab %}

{% tab clientpayloads CAS %}

This allows the CAS server to reach to a remote REST endpoint whose responsibility is to produce the following payload in the response body:

```json
{
    "cas.authn.pac4j.github.client-name": "...",
    "cas.authn.pac4j.github.id": "...",
    "cas.authn.pac4j.github.secret": "...",
    
    "cas.authn.pac4j.cas[0].login-url": "...",
    "cas.authn.pac4j.cas[0].protocol": "..."
}
```

The payload is expected to contain CAS specific properties that would be used to construct external identity providers. The
response that is returned must be accompanied by a `200` status code.

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

## Caching

Note that once identity provider registration data is fetched, the results are cached by CAS 
using a configurable expiration policy and the endpoint is only contacted by CAS if the cache 
content is empty or has been invalidated. This cache is owned by each CAS server node, in case there is more than one
in the same cluster and operations that interact with the cache must be able to apply task to the cache for all CAS server nodes.
