Google Analytics can be used to deliver useful statistics. create custom dimensions and metrics to gain
insight into CAS and user traffic.

<div class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Compatibility</strong><p>
Google Analytics 4 is the next-generation measurement solution, and it has replaced Universal Analytics in CAS. 
On July 1, 2023, standard Universal Analytics properties will stop processing new hits. If you still rely on 
Universal Analytics, we recommend that you prepare to use Google Analytics 4 going forward.
