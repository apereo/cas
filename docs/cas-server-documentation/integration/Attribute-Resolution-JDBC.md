# JDBC Attribute Resolution

CAS does allow for attributes to be retrieved from a variety of SQL databases.
To learn how to configure database drivers, [please see this guide](../installation/JDBC-Drivers.html).

{% include casproperties.html properties="cas.authn.attribute-repository.jdbc" %}

JDBC attribute sources can be defined based on the following mechanics:

## Single Row

Designed to work against a table where there is a mapping of one row to one user.
An example of this table format would be:

| uid      | first_name | last_name | email
|----------|------------|-----------|----------------------
| `jsmith` | `John`     | `Smith`   | `jsmith@example.org`

## Multi Row

Designed to work against a table where there is a mapping of one row to one user.
An example of this table format would be:

| uid      | attr_name    | attr_value
|----------|--------------|-----------------------------
| `jsmith` | `first_name` | `John`
| `jsmith` | `last_name`  | `Smith`
| `jsmith` | `email`      | `jsmith@example.org`

You will need to define column mappings
in your configuration to map the `attr_name` column to the `attr_value` column

# Examples

Suppose CAS is configured to authenticate against Active Directory. The account whose details are defined below
authenticates via `sAMAccountName`.

| Attribute            | Value
|--------------------- |-----------------------
| `sAMAccountName`     | `johnsmith`
| `cn`                 | `John Smith`

## Example #1

If the resolver is configured to use `sAMAccoutName` as the attribute for the principal id, then when authentication is complete the resolver attempts
to construct attributes from attribute repository sources, it sees `sAMAccoutName` as the attribute and sees the principal id is to
be created by `sAMAccoutName`. So it would remove the `sAMAccoutName` from the attributes.
The final result is is a principal whose id is `johnsmith` who has a `cn` attribute of `John Smith`.

## Example #2

If the resolver is configured to use `cn` as the attribute for the principal id, then when authentication is complete the resolver attempts to
construct attributes from attribute repository sources. It then sees `sAMAccoutName` as the attribute and sees the principal id is to be created by `cn`.
So it would remove the `cn` from the attributes. The final result is is a principal whose id is `John Smith`
who has a `sAMAccountName` attribute of `johnsmith`.
