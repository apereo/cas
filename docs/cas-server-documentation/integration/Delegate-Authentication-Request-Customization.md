# Delegated Authentication Request Customization

Authentication (HTTP) requests that are sent from CAS to configured identity providers are can be 
customized at runtime. This customization phase of the authentication request happens right before the request 
is constructed and passed onto the client browser. Before the customizer proceeds, it also must declare its support 
for the given identity provider and/or request, and it also is given the chance to determine if the identity provider 
is authorized for the given request.

## Groovy Customization

The authentication request can be customized using an external Groovy script. 

{% include_cached casproperties.html properties="cas.authn.pac4j.core.groovy-authentication-request-customizer" %}

The outline of the Groovy script would be as follows:
                                                         
```groovy
import org.apereo.cas.authentication.principal.*
import org.apereo.cas.web.*
import org.apereo.cas.web.support.*
import org.pac4j.core.client.*
import org.pac4j.core.context.*
import org.springframework.context.*

def run(Object[] args) {
    def (client,webContext,appContext,logger) = args
    logger.info("Checking ${client.name}...")
    webContext.setRequestAttribute("customAttribute", "value")
}

def supports(Object[] args) {
    def (client,webContext,appContext,logger) = args
    logger.info("Checking support for ${client.name}...")
    return true
}

def isAuthorized(Object[] args) {
    def (client,webContext,service,appContext,logger) = args
    logger.info("Checking authorization for ${client.name}...")
    return true
}
```

The parameters passed are as follows:

| Parameter    | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `client`     | The object representing the identity provider as `IndirectClient`.          |
| `webContext` | The object representing the HTTP request/response as `WebContext`.          |
| `service`    | The `WebApplicationService` for the incoming application request.           |
| `appContext` | The Spring `ApplicationContext`.                                            |
| `logger`     | The object responsible for issuing log messages such as `logger.info(...)`. |
  
## Custom

For more advanced scenarios, you can also design your webflow exception handler
and register it with the CAS at runtime:

```java
@Bean
public DelegatedClientAuthenticationRequestCustomizer myCustomizer() {
    return new DelegatedClientAuthenticationRequestCustomizer();
}
```

[See this guide](../configuration/Configuration-Management-Extensions.html) to learn more
about how to register configurations into the CAS runtime.
