# RC1 Release Notes

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting 
for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` 
is [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS 
releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on 
specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in 
a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by 
experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

## Apereo Membership

If you benefit from Apereo CAS as free and open-source software, we 
invite you to [join the Apereo Foundation](https://www.apereo.org/content/apereo-membership) 
and financially support the project at a capacity that best suits your 
deployment. Note that all development activity is performed 
*almost exclusively* on a voluntary basis with no expectations, commitments or strings 
attached. Having the financial means to better sustain engineering activities will allow 
the developer community to allocate *dedicated and committed* time for long-term 
support, maintenance and release planning, especially when it comes to addressing 
critical and security issues in a timely manner. Funding will ensure support for 
the software you rely on and you gain an advantage and say in the way Apereo, and 
the CAS project at that, runs and operates. If you consider your CAS deployment to 
be a critical part of the identity and access management ecosystem, this is a viable option to consider.

## Get Involved

- Start your CAS deployment today. Try out features and [share feedback](/cas/Mailing-Lists.html).
- Better yet, [contribute patches](/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html).
- Suggest and apply documentation improvements.

## Resources

- [Release Schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones)
- [Release Policy](/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html)

## Overlay

In the `gradle.properties` of the [CAS WAR Overlay](../installation/WAR-Overlay-Installation.html), adjust the following setting:

```properties
cas.version=6.5.0-RC1
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>System Requirements</strong><br/>There are no changes to the 
minimum system/platform requirements for this release.
</div>

## New & Noteworthy

The following items are new improvements and enhancements presented in this release.

### CAS Initializr

The overlay projects backed and generated by the [CAS Initializr](../installation/WAR-Overlay-Initializr.html) 
are now put into a ready-made git repository. Such projects are also prepared by default for 
cloud deployments on the Heroku platform. Furthermore, the metadata for 
the CAS Initializr is now updated to support version compatibility ranges. This would come handy to indicate the 
relationship between a given CAS module and a CAS version that is able to present and work with that module.

### CAS Documentation

CAS documentation is now pre-built and pushed to Github Pages using Jekyll v4, rather than letting GitHub Pages
build the documentation from source. This approach is recommended by GitHub and Jekyll so as to 
assist with Github Pages build performance and configuration.

### Delegated Authentication Discovery Selection

Additional options are now available to [Delegated Authentication](../integration/Delegate-Authentication.html)
to assist with the discovery and selection of identity providers in more dynamic ways.
