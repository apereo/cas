# 8.0.0-RC1 Release Notes

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set
you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note
that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks,
statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular
release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

## Apereo Membership

If you benefit from Apereo CAS as free and open-source software, we invite you
to [join the Apereo Foundation](https://www.apereo.org/content/apereo-membership)
and financially support the project at a capacity that best suits your deployment. Note that all development activity is performed
*almost exclusively* on a voluntary basis with no expectations, commitments or strings attached. Having the financial means to better
sustain engineering activities will allow the developer community to allocate *dedicated and committed* time for long-term support,
maintenance and release planning, especially when it comes to addressing critical and security issues in a timely manner.

## Get Involved

- Start your CAS deployment today. Try out features and [share feedback](/cas/Mailing-Lists.html).
- Better yet, [contribute patches](/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html).
- Suggest and apply documentation improvements.

## Resources

- [Release Schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones)
- [Release Policy](/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html)

## System Requirements

The JDK baseline requirement for this CAS release is and **MUST be JDK `25`**. All compatible distributions
such as Amazon Corretto, Zulu, Eclipse Temurin, etc should work and are implicitly supported.

## New & Noteworthy

The following items are new improvements and enhancements presented in this release.

### OpenRewrite Recipes

CAS continues to produce and publish [OpenRewrite](https://docs.openrewrite.org/) recipes that allow the project to upgrade installations
in place from one version to the next. [See this guide](../installation/OpenRewrite-Upgrade-Recipes.html) to learn more.

### Graal VM Native Images

A CAS server installation and deployment process can be tuned to build and run
as a [Graal VM native image](../installation/GraalVM-NativeImage-Installation.html). We continue to polish native runtime hints.
The collection of end-to-end [browser tests based on Puppeteer](../../developer/Test-Process.html) have selectively switched
to build and verify Graal VM native images and we plan to extend the coverage to all such scenarios in the coming releases.

### Testing Strategy

The collection of end-to-end [browser tests based on Puppeteer](../../developer/Test-Process.html) continue to grow to cover more use cases
and scenarios. At the moment, total number of jobs stands at approximately `526` distinct scenarios. The overall
test coverage of the CAS codebase is approximately `94%`. Furthermore, a large number of test categories that group internal unit tests
are now configured to run with parallelism enabled.

### Gradle 9.2

CAS is now built with Gradle `9.2` and the build process has been updated to use the latest Gradle 
features and capabilities. 
 
### Configuration Properties

CAS configuration properties, specifically those that belong to the `cas` namespace and begin with `cas.`
are now strictly and forcefully validated at startup to reject any unknown properties.
This is done to prevent misconfigurations and typos in property names that would otherwise go unnoticed.
 
### Project Leyden & AOT Caching

Functional tests are updated to use Project Leyden, AOT compilation and caching techniques that are offered
by JDK `25`. This allows tests to run faster by pre-compiling and caching classes and resources ahead of time.
A comparable CAS deployment now roughly takes `5` seconds to startup and be ready to serve requests
as opposed to the previous `7~9` seconds in earlier runs and with previous JDK versions.
     
Support for this functionality will ultimately supersede CDS that is now available to 
[CAS overlay installations](../installation/WAR-Overlay-Initializr.html).

### Google Authenticator Scratch Codes

When storing Google Authenticator accounts inside a relational database, the database column that holds
the scratch codes is now changed to use a `VARCHAR` type to accommodate longer values of scratch codes,
particularly if the codes are set to be encrypted.

<div class="alert alert-warning">:warning: <strong>Breaking Change</strong><p>
This may be a breaking change. You will need to adjust your database schema based on the notes above.</p></div>

### Spring Boot 4

CAS is now built with Spring Boot `4.x`. This is a major platform upgrade that affects almost all aspects of the codebase
including many of the third-party core libraries used by CAS as well as some CAS functionality. The following
notable changes are worth mentioning.

#### Retry Functionality

The `spring-retry` library has been removed and replaced with the native retry capabilities
provided by the Spring Framework. The CAS retry configuration has been updated to reflect this change, which 
brings about the following minor change: retry attempts are set to **ONLY** affect retry operations, and do
not count the initial execution attempt. This means that if a CAS operation is set to retry `3` times, the
operation will be attempted a total of `4` times (`1` initial + `3` retries).

#### Undertow

[Support for Undertow](../installation/Configuring-Servlet-Container-Embedded-Undertow.html) 
as an embedded servlet container has been dropped. Please consider using Apache Tomcat or Jetty
as an alternative embedded server until Undertow adds support for Servlet `6.1`.
We will consider re-adding support for Undertow once it is compatible with our version of Spring Boot.
   
#### JavaMelody

Support for [JavaMelody](../monitoring/Configuring-Monitoring-JavaMelody.html) is not yet compatible with Spring Boot `4`. 
We plan to re-add support for JavaMelody in the future once compatibility is restored.

#### SpringBoot Admin

Support for [Spring Boot Admin](../monitoring/Configuring-SpringBootAdmin.html) is not yet compatible with Spring Boot `4`.
We plan to re-add support for Spring Boot Admin in the future once compatibility is restored.
 
#### Spring Cloud Configuration ZooKeeper

Support for [Spring Cloud Configuration ZooKeeper](../configuration/Configuration-Server-Management-SpringCloud-ZooKeeper.html)
is not yet compatible with Spring Boot `4`. We plan to re-add support for Spring Cloud Configuration ZooKeeper
in the future once compatibility is restored.

#### Spring Cloud Bus

Support for [Spring Cloud Configuration Bus](../configuration/Configuration-Management-Clustered-AMQP.html)
is not yet compatible with Spring Boot `4`. We plan to re-add support for this feature
in the future once compatibility is restored.

#### Jackson & JSON Processing

The Jackson library, responsible for JSON processing and parsing in CAS, is upgraded to `3.x` version. 
This is a major upgrade that brings in many significant changes to the way JSON is processed in CAS. Almost all 
such changes are internal and **SHOULD NOT** affect CAS configuration, application 
records, etc are processed and loaded.

## Other Stuff

- [JPA Ticket Registry](../ticketing/JPA-Ticket-Registry.html) will lowercase all tables names to avoid issues with
  case sensitivity in certain database engines, namely MariaDb.
- PostgreSQL `18` is now the default PostgreSQL version for integration tests.
- A large number of deprecated classes, methods and configuration properties have been removed.
- Attribute values that are presented as valid JSON documents will be formatted as nested claims when collected into an [OpenID Connect ID token](../authentication/OIDC-Authentication-Claims.html).
