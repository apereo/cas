# 8.1.0-RC2 Release Notes

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set
you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note
that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks,
statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular
release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

## Apereo Membership

If you benefit from Apereo CAS as free and open-source software, we invite you
to [join the Apereo Foundation](https://www.apereo.org/content/apereo-membership)
and financially support the project at a capacity that best suits your deployment. Note that all development activity is performed
*almost exclusively* on a voluntary basis with no expectations, commitments or strings attached. Having the financial means to better
sustain engineering activities will allow the developer community to allocate *dedicated and committed* time for long-term support,
maintenance and release planning, especially when it comes to addressing critical and security issues in a timely manner.

## Get Involved

- Start your CAS deployment today. Try out features and [share feedback](/cas/Mailing-Lists.html).
- Better yet, [contribute patches](/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html).
- Suggest and apply documentation improvements.

## Resources

- [Release Schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones)
- [Release Policy](/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html)

## System Requirements

The JDK baseline requirement for this CAS release is and **MUST** be JDK `25`. All compatible distributions
such as Amazon Corretto, Zulu, Eclipse Temurin, etc should work and are implicitly supported.

## New & Noteworthy

The following items are new improvements and enhancements presented in this release.

### OpenRewrite Recipes

CAS continues to produce and publish [OpenRewrite](https://docs.openrewrite.org/) recipes that allow the project to upgrade installations
in place from one version to the next. [See this guide](../installation/OpenRewrite-Upgrade-Recipes.html) to learn more.

### Graal VM Native Images

A CAS server installation and deployment process can be tuned to build and run
as a [Graal VM native image](../installation/GraalVM-NativeImage-Installation.html). We continue to polish native runtime hints.
The collection of end-to-end [browser tests based on Puppeteer](../../developer/Test-Process.html) have selectively switched
to build and verify Graal VM native images and we plan to extend the coverage to all such scenarios in the coming releases.

### Testing Strategy

The collection of end-to-end [browser tests based on Puppeteer](../../developer/Test-Process.html) continue to grow to cover more use cases
and scenarios. At the moment, total number of jobs stands at approximately `556` distinct scenarios. The overall
test coverage of the CAS codebase is approximately `94%`.

### Java 27

CAS may be built and run using Java `27` and the build process has been updated to use 
the latest Java `27` features and capabilities. Please note that this is only a preparatory step for future 
releases and the baseline requirement will remain to be Java `25`.

### Gradle 9.8

CAS is now built with Gradle `9.8` and the build process has been updated to use the
latest Gradle features and capabilities.

### Spring Boot 4.2

CAS is now built on top of Spring Boot `4.2.x`. This is an in-progress ongoing minor platform upgrade that
affects almost all aspects of the codebase including many of the third-party core libraries used by CAS
as well as some CAS functionality.

Please refer to the [Spring Boot Wiki](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-4.2-Release-Notes)
for more information on the changes and updates in this release. The biggest change to CAS would be support for AMQP 1.0.

### JSpecify & NullAway

CAS codebase is now annotated with [JSpecify](https://jspecify.dev/) annotations to indicate nullness contracts on method parameters,
return types and fields. We will gradually extend the coverage of such annotations across the entire codebase in future releases
and will integrate the Gradle build tool with tools such as [NullAway](https://github.com/uber/NullAway) to prevent nullness contract violations
during compile time.
    
### OpenID Connect with DPOP

Single-use checking for DPOP proofs is now enforced using the CAS ticket registry. Furthermore, DPOP requests
are no longer treated as a form of client authentication and now sit on top of existing client authentication
approaches such as `clientId/clientSecret` for confidenial clients or PKCE. 

### OpenID Connect Verifiable Credentials

[OpenID Connect with Verifiable Credentials](../authentication/OIDC-Authentication-Verifiable-Credentials.html) now
may require specific principal attributes before a credential offer transaction can be created for a principal. 

## Other Stuff
    
- OAuth and OpenID Connecty client secrets are now compared and enforced using a case sensitive strategy.          
- A large number of dependencies and libraries have been updated to their latest versions.
