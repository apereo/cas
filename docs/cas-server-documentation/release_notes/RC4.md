# 8.0.0-RC4 Release Notes

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set
you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note
that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks,
statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular
release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

## Apereo Membership

If you benefit from Apereo CAS as free and open-source software, we invite you
to [join the Apereo Foundation](https://www.apereo.org/content/apereo-membership)
and financially support the project at a capacity that best suits your deployment. Note that all development activity is performed
*almost exclusively* on a voluntary basis with no expectations, commitments or strings attached. Having the financial means to better
sustain engineering activities will allow the developer community to allocate *dedicated and committed* time for long-term support,
maintenance and release planning, especially when it comes to addressing critical and security issues in a timely manner.

## Get Involved

- Start your CAS deployment today. Try out features and [share feedback](/cas/Mailing-Lists.html).
- Better yet, [contribute patches](/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html).
- Suggest and apply documentation improvements.

## Resources

- [Release Schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones)
- [Release Policy](/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html)

## System Requirements

The JDK baseline requirement for this CAS release is and **MUST** be JDK `25`. All compatible distributions
such as Amazon Corretto, Zulu, Eclipse Temurin, etc should work and are implicitly supported.

## New & Noteworthy

The following items are new improvements and enhancements presented in this release.

### OpenRewrite Recipes

CAS continues to produce and publish [OpenRewrite](https://docs.openrewrite.org/) recipes that allow the project to upgrade installations
in place from one version to the next. [See this guide](../installation/OpenRewrite-Upgrade-Recipes.html) to learn more.

### Graal VM Native Images

A CAS server installation and deployment process can be tuned to build and run
as a [Graal VM native image](../installation/GraalVM-NativeImage-Installation.html). We continue to polish native runtime hints.
The collection of end-to-end [browser tests based on Puppeteer](../../developer/Test-Process.html) have selectively switched
to build and verify Graal VM native images and we plan to extend the coverage to all such scenarios in the coming releases.

### Testing Strategy

The collection of end-to-end [browser tests based on Puppeteer](../../developer/Test-Process.html) continue to grow to cover more use cases
and scenarios. At the moment, total number of jobs stands at approximately `546` distinct scenarios. The overall
test coverage of the CAS codebase is approximately `94%`.

### Spring Boot 4.1

CAS is now built with Spring Boot `4.1.x`. This is a major platform upgrade that affects almost all aspects of the codebase
including many of the third-party core libraries used by CAS as well as some CAS functionality.

### JSpecify & NullAway

CAS codebase is now annotated with [JSpecify](https://jspecify.dev/) annotations to indicate nullness contracts on method parameters,
return types and fields. We will gradually extend the coverage of such annotations across the entire codebase in future releases
and will integrate the Gradle build tool with tools such as [NullAway](https://github.com/uber/NullAway) to prevent nullness contract violations
during compile time.
  
### OpenId Connect & Verifiable Credentials

An [initial implementation](../authentication/OIDC-Authentication-Verifiable-Credentials.html) 
of OpenID Connect Verifiable Credentials (OIDC4VCI) is now available in CAS. 

### Gradle 9.5

CAS is now built with Gradle `9.5.x` and the build process has been updated to use the latest Gradle
features and capabilities. 

### OpenId Connect Federation & Delegation

Small improvements to OpenID Federation protocol and its support for authentication delegation for OIDC clients.
See [this guide](../integration/Delegate-Authentication-Generic-OpenID-Connect.html) for more details.

### Account Registration

[Account registration flow](../registration/Account-Registration-Overview.html) will automatically 
establish a single sign-on session once the process and flow
is complete. It may also redirect back to the original application if the registration process 
was initiated from a protected resource.

### OpenID Federation

The OpenID Federation support (server) is now in its [own dedicated module](../authentication/OIDC-Authentication-Federation.html).

## Other Stuff
              
- Claims assigned to OpenID Connect custom scopes can now be overridden per client application.
- Minor Gradle build improvements to better handle cacheability of build artifacts.
