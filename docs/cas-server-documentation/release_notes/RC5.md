# 7.3.0-RC5 Release Notes

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set
you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note
that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks,
statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular
release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

## Apereo Membership

If you benefit from Apereo CAS as free and open-source software, we invite you
to [join the Apereo Foundation](https://www.apereo.org/content/apereo-membership)
and financially support the project at a capacity that best suits your deployment. Note that all development activity is performed
*almost exclusively* on a voluntary basis with no expectations, commitments or strings attached. Having the financial means to better
sustain engineering activities will allow the developer community to allocate *dedicated and committed* time for long-term support,
maintenance and release planning, especially when it comes to addressing critical and security issues in a timely manner.

## Get Involved

- Start your CAS deployment today. Try out features and [share feedback](/cas/Mailing-Lists.html).
- Better yet, [contribute patches](/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html).
- Suggest and apply documentation improvements.

## System Requirements

The JDK baseline requirement for this CAS release is and **MUST** be JDK `21`. All compatible distributions
such as Amazon Corretto, Zulu, Eclipse Temurin, etc should work and are implicitly supported.

## New & Noteworthy

The following items are new improvements and enhancements presented in this release.

### Spring Boot 3.5

The migration of the entire codebase to Spring Boot `3.5` is ongoing, and at the moment is waiting for the wider ecosystem
of supporting frameworks and libraries to catch up to changes. We anticipate the work to finalize in the next few
release candidates and certainly prior to the final release.

### OpenRewrite Recipes

CAS continues to produce and publish [OpenRewrite](https://docs.openrewrite.org/) recipes that allow the project to upgrade installations
in place from one version to the next. [See this guide](../installation/OpenRewrite-Upgrade-Recipes.html) to learn more.

### Graal VM Native Images

A CAS server installation and deployment process can be tuned to build and run
as a [Graal VM native image](../installation/GraalVM-NativeImage-Installation.html). We continue to polish native runtime hints.
The collection of end-to-end [browser tests based on Puppeteer](../../developer/Test-Process.html) have selectively switched
to build and verify Graal VM native images and we plan to extend the coverage to all such scenarios in the coming releases.

### Testing Strategy

The collection of end-to-end [browser tests based on Puppeteer](../../developer/Test-Process.html) continue to grow to cover more use cases
and scenarios. At the moment, total number of jobs stands at approximately `511` distinct scenarios. The overall
test coverage of the CAS codebase is approximately `94%`. Furthermore, a large number of test categories that group internal unit tests
are now configured to run with parallelism enabled.

### Java 24

As described, the JDK baseline requirement for this CAS release is and **MUST** be JDK `21`. We are still waiting for the
wider ecosystem of supporting frameworks and libraries to catch up to Java `24`. We anticipate the work to finalize in the next few
release candidates and certainly prior to the final release. Remember that the baseline requirement will remain unchanged
and this is just a preparatory step to ensure CAS is ready for the next version of Java.
