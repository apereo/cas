# RC5 Release Notes

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set 
you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS 
releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain 
confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with 
release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

## Apereo Membership

If you benefit from Apereo CAS as free and open-source software, we 
invite you to [join the Apereo Foundation](https://www.apereo.org/content/apereo-membership) 
and financially support the project at a capacity that best suits your deployment. Note that all development activity 
is performed *almost exclusively* on a voluntary basis with no expectations, commitments or strings attached. Having the financial means to better 
sustain engineering activities will allow the developer community to allocate *dedicated and committed* time for long-term support, 
maintenance and release planning, especially when it comes to addressing critical and security issues in a timely manner. Funding will 
ensure support for the software you rely on and you gain an advantage and say in the way Apereo, and the CAS project at that, runs 
and operates. If you consider your CAS deployment to be a critical part of the identity and access 
management ecosystem, this is a viable option to consider.
