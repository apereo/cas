# Adaptive Authentication - IP Intelligence

CAS provides you with the capability to examine the client IP address and decide whether access should be granted. This may be useful
to detect bot, proxy or VPN traffic and protect your deployment from fraud, automated attacks, crawlers, etc.

The result of the IP address examination may either ban and request the request, allow it to go through, or present a score 
to indicate the probability of an IP address that may be questionable. If the result is ranked score, it will be compared against
the configured risk threshold to determine whether the request may proceed.

Banned IP address can either be defined as patterns in the CAS settings, or they may be examined using the listed strategies below.
 
{% tabs ipintelops %}

{% tab ipintelops REST %}

The client IP address is submitted to a REST endpoint as the
header `clientIpAddress` under a `GET` request. The expected result status codes are the following:

| Code         | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `401`, `403` | IP address is banned and the request will be rejected.                                          |
| `200`, `202` | IP address is allowed and the request may proceed.                                              |
| All Others   | Response body is expected to contain a score between `1` and `0`, (`1=Banned` and `0=Allowed`). |

{% tab ipintelops Groovy %}

The client IP address may be examined using a Groovy script whose outline should match the following:

```groovy
import org.apereo.cas.authentication.principal.*
import org.apereo.cas.authentication.*
import org.apereo.cas.util.*
import org.apereo.cas.authentication.adaptive.intel.*

def run(Object[] args) {
    def (requestContext,clientIpAddress,logger) = args
    
    logger.info("Client ip address provided is ${clientIpAddress}")
    
    if (ipAddressIsRejected())
        return IPAddressIntelligenceResponse.banned()
    
    return IPAddressIntelligenceResponse.allowed()
}
```
