# Acceptto Authentication

Secure your workforce identity with [Acceptto](https://www.acceptto.com) 
end-to-end risk-based multiFactor authentication.

Start by visiting the [Acceptto documentation](https://www.acceptto.com/acceptto-mfa-rest-api/).

Support is enabled by including the following module in the overlay:

{% include casmodule.html group="org.apereo.cas" module="cas-server-support-acceptto-mfa" %}

The integration adds support for both multifactor authentication and QR passwordless authentication.

## Integration with DBFP

The integration is able to handle the integration with DBFP and will set a cookie 
named `jwt` that is passed to the Acceptto API. This parameter contains a value that the server uses 
to assess the risk of authentication request including browser fingerprint, IP address of user and 
GPS location of the userâ€™s browser. The server compares this data with the 
history of user behavior data to detect anomalies.

## Configuration

{% include casproperties.html properties="cas.authn.mfa.acceptto,cas.session-replication" %}
