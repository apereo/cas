# REST Google Authenticator Registration

Registration records may also be passed along to a REST endpoint.
The behavior is only activated when an endpoint url is provided.

| Method    | Headers             | Expected Response     | Behavior
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `GET`     | `username`          | `200`. Account records in the body for the user. | Fetch user records
| `GET`     | `id`                | `200`. Account record in the body for the user. | Fetch record for the given identifier.
| `GET`     | `id`, `username`    | `200`. Account record in the body for the user. | Fetch user record for the given identifier.
| `GET`     | N/A                 | `200`. Account records currently registered. | Fetch all records
| `DELETE`  | N/A                 | `200`. | Delete all records.
| `DELETE`  | `username`          | `200`. Count deleted records. | Delete all records assigned to user
| `POST`    | `username`, `validationCode`, `secretKey`, `scratchCodes`, `name` | `200`. `true/false` in the body. | Save user record

A sample payload that lists device registration records for the user might be:

```json 
[
    "java.util.ArrayList", [{
        "@class": "org.apereo.cas.gauth.credential.GoogleAuthenticatorAccount",
        "scratchCodes": ["java.util.ArrayList", [14883628,81852839,40126334,86724930,54355266] ],
        "id": 123456,
        "secretKey": "UM6ALPJU34CBNFTBBLRFMKBNANMFAIBW",
        "validationCode": 565889,
        "username": "casuser",
        "name": "required-account-name",
        "registrationDate": "2018-06-20T09:47:31.761155Z"
    }]
]
```

The following endpoints need also be available:

| Method    | Endpoint   | Headers           | Expected Response     | Behavior
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `GET`     | `count`    | N/A             | `200`. Numeric count | Count all records
| `GET`     | `count`    | `username`             | `200`. Numeric count | Count all records for the user
