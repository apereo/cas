# Spring Cloud Configuration Server - Spring Cloud HashiCorp Vault

Spring Cloud Configuration Server is able to use [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) to locate properties and settings. 
To learn more about configuration security, [please review this guide](Configuration-Properties-Security.html).

<div class="alert alert-info mt-3">:information_source: <strong>Usage</strong><p>The configuration modules provided here may also be used verbatim inside a CAS server overlay and do not exclusively belong to a Spring Cloud Configuration server. While this module is primarily useful when inside the Spring Cloud Configuration server, it nonetheless may also be used inside a CAS server overlay directly to fetch settings from a source.</p></div>

## Actuator Endpoints

The following endpoints are provided by CAS:

## Token Authentication

Tokens are the core method for authentication within Vault. Token
authentication requires a static token to be provided.

thirdPartyExactMatch="spring.cloud.vault.authentication"
%}

## AppID Authentication

Vault supports AppId authentication that consists of two hard to guess
tokens. The AppId defaults to `spring.application.name` that is statically
configured. The second token is the UserId which is a part determined by the
application, usually related to the runtime environment. Spring Cloud Vault
Config supports IP address, Mac address and static
UserIdâ€™s (e.g. supplied via System properties). The IP and Mac address are
represented as Hex-encoded SHA256 hash.

Using IP addresses:

```bash
export IP_ADDRESS=`echo -n 192.168.99.1 | sha256sum`
```

Using MAC address:

```bash
export $MAC_ADDRESS=`echo -n ABCDEFGH | sha256sum`
```

## Kubernetes Authentication

Kubernetes authentication mechanism allows to authenticate with Vault
using a Kubernetes Service Account Token. The authentication is role
based and the role is bound to a service account name and a namespace.
