# CAS Configuration Storage

Various properties can be specified in CAS [either inside configuration files or as command
line switches](Configuration-Management.html#overview). This section provides a list common CAS properties and
references to the underlying modules that consume them.

This section outlines strategies that can be used to store CAS configuration and settings.

## Standalone

This is the default configuration mode which indicates that CAS does NOT require connections
to an external configuration server and will run in an embedded standalone mode.
  
{% include casproperties.html properties="cas.standalone." excludes="configuration-security" %}

### By Directory

CAS by default will attempt to locate settings and properties inside a given directory and otherwise falls back to using:

1. `/etc/cas/config`
2. `/opt/cas/config`
3. `/var/cas/config`

CAS has the ability to also load a Groovy file for loading settings. The file 
is expected to be found at the above matching
directory and should be named `${cas-application-name}.groovy`, such as `cas.groovy`. The 
script is able to combine conditional settings for active profiles and common settings 
that are applicable to all environments and profiles into one location with a 
structure that is similar to the below example:

```groovy
// Settings may be filtered by individual profiles
profiles {
    standalone {
        cas.some.setting="value"
    }
}

// This applies to all profiles and environments
cas.common.setting="value"
``` 

### By File

You can also use a dedicated configuration file to directly feed a collection of properties
to CAS in form of a file or classpath resource. This is specially useful in cases 
where a bare CAS server is deployed in the cloud without
the extra ceremony of a configuration server or an external directory for 
that matter and the deployer wishes to avoid overriding embedded configuration files.

## Spring Cloud

The following settings are to be loaded by the CAS configuration runtime, which bootstraps
the entire CAS running context. They are to be put inside the `src/main/resources/bootstrap.properties`
of the configuration server itself. See [this guide](Configuration-Server-Management.html) for more info.

The configuration server backed by Spring Cloud supports the following profiles.

### Native

Load settings from external properties/yaml configuration files.

{% include casproperties.html
thirdPartyStartsWith="spring.cloud.config.server.native"
thirdPartyExactMatch="spring.profiles.active"
%}


### Git Repository

Allow the CAS Spring Cloud configuration server to load settings from an internal/external Git repository.
This then allows CAS to become a client of the configuration server, consuming settings over HTTP where needed.

{% include casproperties.html
thirdPartyStartsWith="spring.cloud.config.server.git"
thirdPartyExactMatch="spring.profiles.active"
%}

The above configuration also applies to online git-based repositories such as Github, BitBucket, etc.

### Consul

Allow the CAS Spring Cloud configuration server to load settings from [HashiCorp's Consul](../installation/Service-Discovery-Guide-Consul.html).

{% include casproperties.html
thirdPartyStartsWith="spring.cloud.consul.config"
%}

### Vault

Allow the CAS Spring Cloud configuration server 
to load settings from [HashiCorp's Vault](Configuration-Properties-Security.html).

{% include casproperties.html
thirdPartyStartsWith="spring.cloud.vault"
%}

#### Token Authentication

Tokens are the core method for authentication within Vault. Token 
authentication requires a static token to be provided.

{% include casproperties.html
thirdPartyStartsWith="spring.cloud.vault.token"
thirdPartyExactMatch="spring.cloud.vault.authentication"
%}

#### AppID Authentication

Vault supports AppId authentication that consists of two hard to guess 
tokens. The AppId defaults to `spring.application.name` that is statically 
configured. The second token is the UserId which is a part determined by the 
application, usually related to the runtime environment. Spring Cloud Vault 
Config supports IP address, Mac address and static
UserIdâ€™s (e.g. supplied via System properties). The IP and Mac address are 
represented as Hex-encoded SHA256 hash.

Using IP addresses:

```bash
export IP_ADDRESS=`echo -n 192.168.99.1 | sha256sum`
```

Using MAC address:

```bash
export $MAC_ADDRESS=`echo -n ABCDEFGH | sha256sum`
```

{% include casproperties.html
thirdPartyStartsWith="spring.cloud.vault.app-id"
thirdPartyExactMatch="spring.cloud.vault.authentication"
%}


#### Kubernetes Authentication

Kubernetes authentication mechanism allows to authenticate with Vault 
using a Kubernetes Service Account Token. The authentication is role 
based and the role is bound to a service account name and a namespace.

{% include casproperties.html 
thirdPartyStartsWith="spring.cloud.vault.kubernetes"
thirdPartyExactMatch="spring.cloud.vault.authentication"
%}

#### Generic Backend v1

{% include casproperties.html thirdPartyStartsWith="spring.cloud.vault.generic" %}

#### KV Backend v2

{% include casproperties.html thirdPartyStartsWith="spring.cloud.vault.kv" %}

### MongoDb

Allow the CAS Spring Cloud configuration server to load settings from a MongoDb instance.

{% include casproperties.html properties="cas.spring.cloud.mongo" %}

### Azure KeyVault Secrets

Allow the CAS Spring Cloud configuration server to load settings from Microsoft Azure's KeyVault instance.

{% include casproperties.html thirdPartyStartsWith="azure.keyvault" %}

### ZooKeeper

Allow the CAS Spring Cloud configuration server to load settings from an Apache ZooKeeper instance.

{% include casproperties.html thirdPartyStartsWith="spring.cloud.zookeeper" %}

### Amazon Secrets Manager

{% include casproperties.html properties="cas.spring.cloud.aws.secrets-manager" %}

### Amazon Parameter Store

{% include casproperties.html properties="cas.spring.cloud.aws.ssm" %}

### Amazon S3

{% include casproperties.html properties="cas.spring.cloud.aws.s3" %}

```properties
# ${configuration-key}.bucket-name=cas-properties
```

### DynamoDb

{% include casproperties.html properties="cas.spring.cloud.dynamo-db" %}

### JDBC

Allow the CAS Spring Cloud configuration server to load settings from a RDBMS instance.

{% include casproperties.html properties="cas.spring.cloud.jdbc" %}

### REST

Allow the CAS Spring Cloud configuration server to load settings from a REST API.

{% include casproperties.html properties="cas.spring.cloud.rest" %}
