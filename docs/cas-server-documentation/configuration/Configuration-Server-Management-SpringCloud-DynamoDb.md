# Spring Cloud Configuration Server - Spring Cloud DynamoDb

CAS is also able to use [DynamoDb](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) to locate properties and settings.

Support is provided via the following dependency in the WAR overlay:

{% include_cached casmodule.html group="org.apereo.cas" module="cas-server-support-configuration-cloud-dynamodb" %}

<div class="alert alert-info mt-3">:information_source: <strong>Usage</strong><p>The configuration modules provided here may also be used verbatim inside a CAS server overlay and do not exclusively belong to a Spring Cloud Configuration server. While this module is primarily useful when inside the Spring Cloud Configuration server, it nonetheless may also be used inside a CAS server overlay directly to fetch settings from a source.</p></div>


The `DynamoDbCasProperties` table is automatically created by CAS with the following structure:

```json
{
    "id": "primary-key",
    "name": "the-setting-name",
    "value": "the-setting-value"
}
```

{% include_cached casproperties.html properties="cas.spring.cloud.dynamo-db" %}
