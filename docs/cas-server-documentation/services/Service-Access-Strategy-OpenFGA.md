# Service Access Strategy - OpenFGA

[OpenFGA](https://github.com/openfga/openfga) is a fast, flexible Fine-Grained Authorization system 
that has been designed for reliability and low latency at a high scale. Itâ€™s designed, built, and sponsored by Okta/Auth0.

This access strategy builds an authorization request and submits it to OpenFGA's `check` API endpoint. The specifics
of the authorization request are taught to CAS using the settings typically defined within the access strategy itself:

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.CasRegisteredService",
  "serviceId" : "^https://.+",
  "name" : "test",
  "id" : 1,
  "accessStrategy" : {
    "@class": "org.apereo.cas.services.OpenFGARegisteredServiceAccessStrategy",
    "apiUrl": "http://localhost:8080",
    "object": "my-document",
    "relation": "owner",
    "storeId": "Y75hgyt75mhp",
    "token": "92d4a401-86b4-4636-b742-a7c8034756a0"
  }
}
```

The following fields are available to this access strategy:
