# Amazon S3 Service Registry

Stores registered service data in a [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) buckets. Each service 
definition is managed inside its own separate bucket and the body of the service definition is managed 
as a JSON blob, similar to that of [JSON service registry](JSON-Service-Management.html).

Support is enabled by adding the following module into the overlay:

{% include casmodule.html group="org.apereo.cas" module="cas-server-support-aws-s3-service-registry" %}

## Configuration

{% include casproperties.html properties="cas.service-registry.amazon-s3" %}

## Troubleshooting

To enable additional logging, configure the log4j configuration file to add the following levels:

```xml
...
<Logger name="com.amazonaws" level="debug" additivity="false">
    <AppenderRef ref="console"/>
    <AppenderRef ref="file"/>
</Logger>
...
```

## Auto Initialization

Upon startup and configuration permitting, the registry is able to auto initialize itself from default JSON service 
definitions available to CAS. See [this guide](AutoInitialization-Service-Management.html) for more info.
