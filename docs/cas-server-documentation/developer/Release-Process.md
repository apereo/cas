# CAS Release Process

This page documents the steps that a release engineer should take for cutting a CAS server release. 

## Sonatype Setup

You will need to sign up for a [Sonatype account](https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) and must ask 
to be authorized to publish releases to the `org.apereo` package by creating a JIRA. Once you have, you may be asked to have one of the
current project members *vouch* for you. 

## GPG Setup

You will need to [generate your own PGP signatures](https://blog.sonatype.com/2010/01/how-to-generate-pgp-signatures-with-maven/) to 
sign the release artifacts prior to uploading them to a central repository. In order to create OpenPGP signatures, you will 
need to generate a key pair. You need to provide the build with your key information, which means three things:

- The public key ID (The last 8 symbols of the keyId. You can use `gpg -K` to get it).
- The absolute path to the secret key ring file containing your private key. Since gpg 2.1, you need to export the keys with command:

```bash
gpg --keyring secring.gpg --export-secret-keys > ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg
```

- The passphrase used to protect your private key.

The above settings will need to be placed into the `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file:

```properties
signing.keyId=7A24P9QB
signing.password=P@$$w0rd
signing.secretKeyRingFile=/Users/example/.gnupg/secring.gpg
```

Additional notes on how artifacts are signed using the Gradle 
signing plugin are [available here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html)

## Environment Setup

- Load your SSH key and ensure this SSH key is also referenced in GitHub.
- Adjust `$GRADLE_OPTS` to initialize the JVM heap size, if necessary.
- Load your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file with the following *as an example*:

```properties
org.gradle.daemon=false
org.gradle.parallel=false
```

- Checkout the CAS project: `git clone git@github.com:apereo/cas.git cas-server`
- Make sure you have the [latest version of JDK 21](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/21/) installed via `java -version`. 

## Preparing the Release

Apply the following steps to prepare the release environment. There are a few variations to take into account depending on whether
a new release branch should be created. 

### Create Branch

```bash
# Replace $BRANCH with CAS version (i.e. 6.5.x)
git checkout -b $BRANCH
```

<div class="alert alert-warning">:warning: <strong>Remember</strong><p>You should do this only for major or minor 
releases (i.e. <code>4.2.x</code>, <code>5.0.x</code>).
If there already exists a remote tracking branch for the version you are about to release, you should <code>git checkout</code> that branch, 
skip this step and move on to next section to build and release.</p></div>

### GitHub Actions

<div class="alert alert-warning">:warning: <strong>Remember</strong><p>You should do this only for major or minor 
releases, when new branches are created.</p></div>
 
Change GitHub Actions workflows to trigger and *only* build the newly-created release branch:

* Modify the `analysis.yml` workflow to run on the newly-created branch.
* Modify the `validation.yml` workflow to run on the newly-created branch.
* Modify the `publish.yml` workflow to run on the newly-created branch.
* Modify the `publish-docs.yml` to point to the newly-created branch.
* Modify the `functional-tests.yml` to point to the newly-created branch.
* Modify the `native-tests.yml` to point to the newly-created branch.
* Disable the following workflows: `build.yml`, `dependencies.yml`, `native-tests`, `tests`. These can be disabled in the YAML configuration via:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches-ignore:
      - '**'
```

Do not forget to commit all changes and push changes upstream, creating a new remote branch to track the release.

## Performing the Release 

- In the project's `gradle.properties`, change the project version to the release version and remove the `-SNAPSHOT`. (i.e. `6.0.0-RC1`). 
- Build and release the project using the following command:

```bash
./release.sh
```

The script will prompt for the appropriate Sonatype username and password (or user token). You can also run the script in non-interactive
mode by specifying the credentials beforehand as environment variables:

```json
export REPOSITORY_USER="..."
export REPOSITORY_PWD="..."
```

Do not use your actual password and instead create a a user token. This is a form of credential for the user 
it belongs to and is  completely different and separate from the original password. User tokens can be easily 
created and deleted, which is useful should security policies require credential updates, or 
if credentials are lost accidentally or otherwise.

## Finalizing the Release

- Create a tag for the released version, commit the change and push the tag to the upstream repository. (i.e. `v5.0.0-RC1`).

You should also switch back to the main development branch (i.e. `master`) and follow these steps:

- In the project's `gradle.properties`, change the project version to the *next* development version (i.e. `5.0.0-SNAPSHOT`). 
- Push your changes to the upstream repository. 

## Housekeeping

<div class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Remember</strong><p>When updating the release description, try to be keep 
consistent and follow the same layout as previous releases.</p></div>

Remember to mark the release tag as pre-release, when releasing RC versions of the project on GitHub. 

## Update CAS Initializr

Make sure to update the CAS Initializr to allow for generation of projects
based on the newly-released version.

## Update Documentation

<div class="alert alert-warning">:warning: <strong>Remember</strong><p>You should do this only for major or minor releases, when new branches are created.</p></div>

- Configure docs to point `current` to the latest available version [here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/blob/gh-pages/current/index.html).
- Modify the `cas-server-documentation/_config.yml` file to exclude relevant branches and directories from the build. 
- Configure docs to include the new release in the list of [available versions](https://github.com/apereo/cas/blob/gh-pages/_layouts/default.html).
- Update the project's [`README.md` page](https://github.com/apereo/cas/blob/master/README.md) to list the new version, if necessary.
- Update [the build process](Build-Process.html) to include any needed information on how to build the new release.
- Update the release notes overview and remove all previous entries.
- Send a pull request to [Algolia](https://crawler.algolia.com/) for the new documentation version to index the new space for search requests.

## Update Maintenance Policy

<div class="alert alert-warning">:warning: <strong>Remember</strong><p>You should do this only for major or minor releases, when new branches are created.</p></div>

Update the [Maintenance Policy](https://github.com/apereo/cas/edit/gh-pages/developer/Maintenance-Policy.md/) to note 
the release schedule and EOL timeline.
