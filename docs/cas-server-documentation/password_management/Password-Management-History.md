# Password History - Password Management

CAS allows for strategies to track and storage recycled password. Recycled 
passwords are kept in storage for the user account and are 
examined upon password updates for validity.

Once password history functionality is enabled, passwords can be tracked 
in history via a Groovy or an in-memory backend. Specific storage 
options may also provide their own support for password history.
 
## Groovy

Password history tracking, once enabled, can be handed off to an external Groovy script as such:

```groovy
def exists(Object[] args) {
    def request = args[0]
    def logger = args[1]
    return false
}

def store(Object[] args) {
    def request = args[0]
    def logger = args[1]
    return true
}

def fetchAll(Object[] args) {
    def logger = args[0]
    return []
}

def fetch(Object[] args) {
    def username = args[0]
    def logger = args[1]
    return []
}   

def remove(Object[] args) { 
    def username = args[0]
    def logger = args[1]
}

def removeAll(Object[] args) { 
    def logger = args[0]
}
```

The `request` parameter encapsulates a `PasswordChangeRequest` object, carrying `username` and `password` fields.
