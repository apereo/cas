# Simple Storage - CAS Metrics

Micrometer ships with a simple, in-memory backend that is automatically
used as a fallback if no other registry is configured.
This allows you to see what metrics are collected in the metrics endpoint.

The in-memory backend disables itself as soon as youâ€™re using any of
the other available backend. You can also disable it explicitly:
