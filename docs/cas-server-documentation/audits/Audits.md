# Audits

CAS uses its own *Inspektr* framework for auditing purposes and statistics. This framework used to be a separate project
and lived outside the codebase previously and has since been merged entirely into the CAS codebase. The Inspektr components 
allow for non-intrusive auditing and logging of the coarse-grained execution paths e.g. Spring-managed 
beans method executions by using annotations and Spring-managed `@Aspect`-style aspects.

CAS server auto-configures all the relevant Inspektr components. All the available configuration
options that are injected to Inspektr classes are available to deployers via relevant CAS properties.
Note that the audit record management functionality of CAS supports handling multiple audit
record destinations at the same time. In other words, you may choose to route audit records
to both a database and a REST endpoint as well as any number of logger-based destinations all at the same time.

## Actuator Endpoints

The following endpoints are provided by CAS:

{% include_cached actuators.html endpoints="auditLog,auditevents" casModule="cas-server-support-reports" %}

## Storage

Audits can be managed via the following strategies.

| Storage     | Description                             |

## Audit Events

The following events are tracked and recorded in the audit log:

<table class="cas-datatable paginated-table" id="table-theme-properties">
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        {% for cfg in site.data[siteDataVersion]["audits"] %}
            {% assign configBlock = cfg[1] %}
            {% for config in configBlock %}
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <code>{{ config.name }}</code>
                </td>
            </tr>
            {% endfor %}
        {% endfor %}
    </tbody>
</table>
