# User Profiles - OAuth Authentication

The requested user profile may be rendered and consumed by the application using the following options.

## Nested

By default, the requested user profile is rendered using a `NESTED` format where 
the authenticated principal and attributes are placed inside `id` and `attributes` tags 
respectively in the final structure.

```json
{
  "id": "casuser",
  "attributes": {
    "email": "casuser@example.org",
    "name": "CAS"
  },
  "something": "else"
}
```

## Flat

This option flattens principal attributes by one degree, putting them 
at the same level as `id`. Other nested elements in the final payload are left untouched.

```json
{
  "id": "casuser",
  "email": "casuser@example.org",
  "name": "CAS",
  "something": "else"
}
```

## Custom

If you wish to create your own profile structure, you will need to 
design a component and register it with CAS to handle the rendering of the user profile:

```java
package org.apereo.cas.support.oauth;

@Configuration("MyOAuthConfiguration")
@EnableConfigurationProperties(CasConfigurationProperties.class)
public class MyOAuthConfiguration {

    @Bean
    @RefreshScope
    public OAuth20UserProfileViewRenderer oauthUserProfileViewRenderer() {
        ...
    }
}
```

[See this guide](../configuration/Configuration-Management-Extensions.html) to learn more about 
how to register configurations into the CAS runtime.
