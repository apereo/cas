# Custom Surrogate Authentication Registration

If you wish to design your own account store, you may follow the below approach:

```java
package org.apereo.cas.custom;

@Configuration("mySurrogateConfiguration")
@EnableConfigurationProperties(CasConfigurationProperties.class)
public class MySurrogateConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public SurrogateAuthenticationService surrogateAuthenticationService() {
      ...
    }

}
```

[See this guide](../configuration/Configuration-Management-Extensions.html) to learn more about how to register configurations into the CAS runtime.
