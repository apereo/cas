# Client Registration - OAuth Authentication

Every OAuth relying party must be defined as a CAS service:

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.support.oauth.services.OAuthRegisteredService",
  "clientId": "clientid",
  "clientSecret": "clientSecret",
  "serviceId" : "^(https|imaps)://<redirect-uri>.*",
  "name" : "OAuthService",
  "id" : 100,
  "supportedGrantTypes": [ "java.util.HashSet", [ "...", "..." ] ],
  "supportedResponseTypes": [ "java.util.HashSet", [ "...", "..." ] ]
}
```

The following fields are supported:

| Field                             | Description
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `clientId`                        | The client identifier for the application/service.
| `clientSecret`                    | The client secret for the application/service.
| `supportedGrantTypes`             | Collection of supported grant types for this service.
| `supportedResponseTypes`          | Collection of supported response types for this service.
| `bypassApprovalPrompt`            | Whether approval prompt/consent screen should be bypassed. Default is `false`.
| `generateRefreshToken`            | Whether a refresh token should be generated along with the access token. Default is `false`.
| `renewRefreshToken`               | Whether the existing refresh token should be expired and a new one generated (and sent along) whenever a new access token is requested (with `grant_type` = `refresh_token`). Only possible if `generateRefreshToken` is set to `true`. Default is `false`.
| `jwtAccessToken`                  | Whether access tokens should be created as JWTs. Default is `false`.
| `serviceId`                       | The pattern that authorizes the redirect URI(s), or same as `clientId` in case `redirect_uri` is not required by the grant type (i.e `client_credentials`, etc).

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Keep What You Need!</strong><p>You are encouraged to only keep and maintain properties and settings needed for a particular integration. It is <strong>UNNECESSARY</strong> to grab a copy of all service fields and try to configure them yet again based on their default. While you may wish to keep a copy as a reference, this strategy would ultimately lead to poor upgrades increasing chances of breaking changes and a messy deployment at that.</p></div>

Service definitions are typically managed by the [service management](../services/Service-Management.html) facility.

<div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Usage Warning!</strong><p>CAS today does not strictly enforce the collection of authorized supported response/grant types for backward compatibility reasons. This means that if left undefined, all grant and response types may be allowed by the service definition and related policies. Do please note that this behavior is <strong>subject to change</strong> in future releases and thus, it is strongly recommended that all authorized grant/response types for each profile be declared in the service definition immediately to avoid surprises in the future.</p></div>

## Encryptable Client Secrets

Client secrets for OAuth relying parties may be defined as encrypted values prefixed with `{cas-cipher}`:

```json
{
  "@class": "org.apereo.cas.support.oauth.services.OAuthRegisteredService",
  "clientId": "clientid",
  "clientSecret": "{cas-cipher}eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIs...",
  "serviceId" : "^(https|imaps)://<redirect-uri>.*",
  "name": "Sample",
  "id": 100
}
```

Client secrets may be encrypted using CAS-provided cipher operations 
either manually or via the [CAS Command-line shell](../installation/Configuring-Commandline-Shell.html).

## Attribute Release

Attribute/claim filtering and release policies are defined per OAuth service.
See [this guide](../integration/Attribute-Release-Policies.html) for more info.
