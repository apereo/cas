# LDAP Authentication

LDAP integration is enabled by including the following dependency in the overlay:

{% include casmodule.html group="org.apereo.cas" module="cas-server-support-ldap" %}

## Configuration

CAS authenticates a username/password against an LDAP directory such as Active Directory or OpenLDAP.
There are numerous directory architectures and we provide configuration for four common cases.

Note that CAS will automatically create the appropriate components internally
based on the settings specified below. If you wish to authenticate against more than one LDAP
server, increment the index and specify the settings for the next LDAP server.

**Note:** Attributes retrieved as part of LDAP authentication are merged with all attributes
retrieved from other attribute repository sources, if any.
Attributes retrieved directly as part of LDAP authentication trump all other attributes.

{% include casproperties.html properties="cas.authn.ldap" %}


## Password Policy Enforcement

To learn how to enforce a password policy for LDAP, please [review this guide](../installation/Password-Policy-Enforcement.html).

## Troubleshooting

To enable additional logging, modify the logging configuration file to add the following:

```xml
<Logger name="org.ldaptive" level="debug" additivity="false">
    <AppenderRef ref="console"/>
    <AppenderRef ref="file"/>
</Logger>
```
