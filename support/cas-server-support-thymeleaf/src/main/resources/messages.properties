  out.
screen.logout.security=For security reasons, exit your web browser.
screen.logout.pending=Logout request pending…

screen.service.wildcard.message=This application does not have a dedicated registration entry in the CAS service registry. \
  It is authorized and allowed by CAS because there exists a wildcarded service definition entry in the CAS service registry \
  that allows and accepts authentication requests from unknown applications such as this one. \
  <p/>As a security best practice, it is strongly recommended to limit the service management facility to <strong>only include the list of \
  known applications</strong> that are explicitly authorized to use CAS. Leaving the management interface open for all applications \
  may create an opportunity for security attacks and will make it difficult to audit application requirements and attribute needs.

authenticationFailure.AccountPasswordMustChangeException=Your account password has expired and must be changed.
authenticationFailure.UnauthorizedServiceForPrincipalException=Service access denied due to missing privileges.

authenticationFailure.MultifactorAuthenticationFailedException=Multifactor authentication attempt has failed, likely due to invalid multifactor authentication credentials. \
  Please verify and try again.
authenticationFailure.RiskyAuthenticationException=CAS is unable to proceed with the authentication flow, likely because this authentication attempt \
  is determined to be risky and suspicious with a high-enough risk score above the accepted threshold. It may be that your attempt at \
  authentication is blocked because you are using an unknown web browser, or you are logging in from an unknown location. \
  For additional information and guidance, please contact your administrator and/or help desk.

authenticationFailure.AuthenticationException=Credentials are rejected/invalid and authentication attempt has failed.

INVALID_REQUEST_PROXY=The request is incorrectly formatted. Ensure all required parameters are properly encoded and included.

UNSATISFIED_AUTHN_POLICY=Service access denied due to an unsatisfied authentication policy.
INVALID_AUTHN_REQUEST=Authentication attempt has failed, likely due to invalid credentials.
BLOCKED_AUTHN_REQUEST=Authentication attempt is blocked and cannot proceed, likely due to malformed or missing required parameters. \
  Examine the CAS server logs to locate the root cause of the error.
UNSATISFIED_SAML_REQUEST=The SAML authentication request cannot be understood, accepted or validated by CAS, \
  likely due to malformed or missing required parameters. Please examine the CAS server logs to locate the root cause of the error.
MISSING_SAML_REQUEST=SAML2 authentication request cannot be determined from the CAS session store. \
  This typically means that the original SAML2 authentication request that was submitted to CAS via a SAML2 service provider \
  cannot be retrieved and restored after an authentication attempt likely because the underlying session store either removed \
  the authentication request forcefully or determined the tracked request was expired and stale, beyond what the session store \
  expiration policy allows. Please examine the CAS server logs to locate the root cause of the error.
screen.service.error.header=Application Not Authorized to Use CAS
screen.service.error.redirect=You are not authorized to access this application. Please be patient as you are about \
  to be redirected to <strong>{0}</strong> to learn more about this scenario.

  Either the principal could not be resolved correctly as a single unique entity or CAS has found \
  mixed/multiple candidate principals and is unable to decide which should be used. \
  This error may also be caused if the authenticated principal is not allowed to access the target application \
  due to missing privileges set by the CAS server authorization policies.
service.not.authorized.missing.attr=You are not authorized to access the application as your account \
is missing privileges required by the CAS server to authenticate into this service. Please notify your support desk.
screen.service.error.message=The application you attempted to authenticate to is not authorized to use CAS. \
  This usually indicates that the application is not registered with CAS, or its authorization policy defined in its registration record \
  prevents it from leveraging CAS functionality, or it's malformed and unrecognized by CAS. \
  Contact your CAS administrator to learn how you might register and integrate your application with CAS.
screen.service.empty.error.message=The services registry of CAS is empty and has no service definitions. \
Applications that wish to authenticate with CAS must explicitly be defined in the services’ registry.
