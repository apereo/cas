screen.service.wildcard.message=This application does not have a dedicated registration entry in the CAS service registry. \
  It is authorized and allowed by CAS because there exists a wildcarded service definition entry in the CAS service registry \
  that allows and accepts authentication requests from unknown applications as such as this one. \
  <p/>As a security best practice, it is strongly recommended to limit the service management facility to only include the list of \
  known applications that are explicitly authorized to use CAS. Leaving the management interface open for all applications \
  may create an opportunity for security attacks and will make it difficult to audit application requirements and attribute needs.
