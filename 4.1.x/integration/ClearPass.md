# ClearPass: Credential Caching and Replay
To enable single sign-on into some legacy application it may be necessary to provide them with the actual password. While such approach inevitably increases security risk, at times this may be a necessary evil in order to integrate applications with CAS.

<div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Usage Warning!</strong><p>ClearPass is turned off by default. No applications will be able to obtain the user credentials unless ClearPass is explicitly turned on by the below configuration.</p></div>

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>ClearPass via Proxying!</strong><p>If you wish to review the configuration for ClearPass via proxying, please <a href="ClearPass-Proxy-Authentication.html">see this link instead</a>.</p></div>

## Architecture
CAS is able to issue the credential password directly in the CAS validation response. This previously was handled via a proxy authentication sequence and obtaining a proxy-granting ticket for the ClearPass service and was necessary in order to establish trust between the client application and the CAS server. This document describes the configuration that can be applied in order to receive the credential password as an attribute in the CAS validation response.

In order to successfully establish trust between the
CAS server and the application, private/public key pairs are generated by the client application and then **the public key** distributed and configured inside CAS. CAS will use the public key to encrypt the credential password and will issue a new attribute `<credential>` in the validation response, only if the service is authorized to receive it.

Note that the return of the credential is only carried out by the CAS validation response, provided the client
application issues a request to the `/p3/serviceValidate` endpoint  (or `/p3/proxyValidate`). Other means of returning attributes to CAS, such as SAML1 will **not** support the additional returning of this value.

## Configuration

### Capture Credential
Enable this configuration in your `deployerConfigContext.xml` file:

```xml
<property name="authenticationMetaDataPopulators">
  <util:list>
    <bean class="org.jasig.cas.authentication.CacheCredentialsMetaDataPopulator"/>
  </util:list>
</property>
```

### Register Service
Once you have received the public key from the client application owner, it must be first
registered inside the CAS server's service registry. The service that holds the public key above must also
be authorized to receive the password
as an attribute for the given attribute release policy of choice.

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.jasig.cas.services.RegexRegisteredService",
  "serviceId" : "^https://.+",
  "name" : "test",
  "id" : 1,
  "evaluationOrder" : 0,
  "attributeReleasePolicy" : {
    "@class" : "org.jasig.cas.services.ReturnAllowedAttributeReleasePolicy",
    "principalAttributesRepository" : {
      "@class" : "org.jasig.cas.authentication.principal.DefaultPrincipalAttributesRepository"
    },
    "authorizedToReleaseCredentialPassword" : true,
    "authorizedToReleaseProxyGrantingTicket" : false
  },
  "publicKey" : {
    "@class" : "org.jasig.cas.services.RegisteredServicePublicKeyImpl",
    "location" : "classpath:RSA1024Public.key",
    "algorithm" : "RSA"
  }
}
```

### Decrypt the Password
Once the client application has received the `credential` attribute in the CAS validation response, it can decrypt it via its own private key. Since the attribute is base64 encoded by default, it needs to be decoded first before
decryption can occur. Here's a sample code snippet:

```java

final Map<?, ?> attributes = ...
final String encodedPsw = (String) attributes.get("credential");
final PrivateKey privateKey = ...
final Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(privateKey.getAlgorithm());
final byte[] cred64 = decodeBase64ToByteArray(encodedPsw);
cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privateKey);
final byte[] cipherData = cipher.doFinal(cred64);
return new String(cipherData);

```
