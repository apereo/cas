/**
 * This is {@link AuthenticationServiceSelectionStrategy} which attempts to
 * resolve and nominate a service during a validation event. By default
 * most services provided to CAS are taken and resolved verbatim. However,
 * in scenarios where a given module ends up inserting target service identifiers
 * into the service parameter as query strings where the final service URL is
 * designated to be a callback url to CAS which carries the real service identifier,
 * (such as SAML2 support where callbacks are used to route the request back to CAS),
 * an implementation of this strategy may be used to detect the query parameters
 * inside the URL to use the real service for user attribute processing and more.
 * Services resolved via this strategy must still be vetted against the service registry.
