 * This is {@link CredentialTrait}. This is typically designed

 * with capability, and specific characteristics. For example, a typical
 * trait might be that a credential object can be impersonated.
 * Each {@link Credential} may carry a collection of traits, which allows
 * implementations to tag and decorate credentials with specific behavior
 * and attach those to the credential as trait without having to define
 * multiple credentials via inheritance.
