/**
 * This is {@link TicketDefinitionProperties}. Ticket definition describes additional Properties and misc settings
 * that may be associated with a given ticket to be used by registries. Each CAS module on start up
 * has the ability to register/alter ticket metadata that may be requires for its own specific functionality.
 * Given each CAS module may decide to create many forms of tickets, this facility is specifically provided
 * to dynamically register ticket types and associated properties so modules that deal with registry functionality
 * wouldn't have to statically link to all modules and APIs.
 * <p>
 * Ticket definition properties are intended to be treated as generally as possible, so common settings
 * can be shared across all modules that may have similar needs. When adding additional properties, be careful
 * to not tie the setting to a specific technology or terminology, and opt for generality as much as possible.
