     * At times, CAS needs to determine the correct provider when step-up authentication is required.
     * Consider for a moment that CAS already has established an SSO session with/without a provider and has
     * reached a level of authentication. Another incoming request attempts to exercise that SSO
     * session with a different and often competing authentication requirement that may differ from the
     * authentication level CAS has already established. Concretely, examples may be:
     * <ul>
     * <li>CAS has achieved an SSO session, but a separate request now requires step-up authentication with DuoSecurity.</li>
     * <li>CAS has achieved an SSO session with an authentication level satisfied by DuoSecurity,
     * but a separate request now requires step-up authentication with YubiKey. </li>
     * </ul>
     * In certain scenarios, CAS will attempt to rank authentication levels and compare them with each other.
     * If CAS already has achieved a level that is higher than what the incoming request requires,
     * no step-up authentication will be performed. If the opposite is true, CAS will route the authentication
     * flow to the required authentication level and upon success, will adjust the SSO session with the
     * new higher authentication level now satisfied.
     * Ranking of authentication methods is done per provider via specific properties for each.
     * Note that the higher the rank value is, the higher on the security scale it remains.
     * A provider that ranks higher with a larger weight value trumps and override others with a lower value.
