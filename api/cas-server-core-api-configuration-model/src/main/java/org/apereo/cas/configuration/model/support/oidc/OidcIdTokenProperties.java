     * regardless of the response type. Note that this setting <strong>MUST ONLY</strong> be used

     * <strong>DO NOT</strong> use this setting without due consideration.
     * <p>
     * Note that this setting is set to {@code true} by default mainly
     * provided to preserve backward compatibility with
     * previous CAS versions that included claims into the ID token without considering
     * the response type. The behavior of this setting may change and it may be removed
     * in future CAS releases.
