     * Not yet replicated values are returned as non-existing (null). </li>
     * <li>Second, you can configure for a synchronous initial fill up (by configuring the
     * async fill up to false), which blocks every read or write access to the map
     * until the fill up operation is finished. Use this with caution since

     * A Replicated Map is a distributed key-value data structure where the data is replicated
     * to all members in the cluster. It provides full replication of
     * entries to all members for high speed access. A Replicated Map does not partition data
     * (it does not spread data to different cluster members); instead, it replicates the data to all members.
     * Replication leads to higher memory consumption. However, a Replicated Map has faster
     * read and write access since the data is available on all members.
     * Writes could take place on local/remote members in order to provide
     * write-order, eventually being replicated to all other members.
     *
     * <br><p>
     * If you have a large cluster or very high occurrences of updates, the Replicated Map may not
     * scale linearly as expected since it has to replicate update operations to all members in the cluster.
     * Since the replication of updates is performed in an asynchronous manner, Hazelcast recommends you
     * enable back pressure in case your system has high occurrences of updates.
     * <p>
     * Note that Replicated Map does not guarantee eventual consistency because there are
     * some edge cases that fail to provide consistency.
     *
     * <br><p>
     * Replicated Map uses the internal partition system of Hazelcast in order to
     * serialize updates happening on the same key at the same time. This happens by
     * sending updates of the same key to the same Hazelcast member in the cluster.
     *
     * <br><p>
     * Due to the asynchronous nature of replication, a Hazelcast member could die before successfully
     * replicating a "write" operation to other members after sending the "write completed"
     * response to its caller during the write process. In this scenario, Hazelcastâ€™s internal
     * partition system promotes one of the replicas of the partition as the primary one.
     * The new primary partition does not have the latest "write" since the
     * dead member could not successfully replicate the update.
