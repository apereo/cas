			| This is the List of CredentialToPrincipalResolvers that identify what Principal is trying to authenticate.
			| The AuthenticationManagerImpl considers them in order, finding a CredentialToPrincipalResolver which 
			| supports the presented credentials.
			|
			| AuthenticationManagerImpl uses these resolvers for two purposes.  First, it uses them to identify the Principal
			| attempting to authenticate to CAS /login .  In the default configuration, it is the DefaultCredentialsToPrincipalResolver
			| that fills this role.  If you are using some other kind of credentials than UsernamePasswordCredentials, you will need to replace
			| DefaultCredentialsToPrincipalResolver with a CredentialsToPrincipalResolver that supports the credentials you are
			| using.
			|
			| Second, AuthenticationManagerImpl uses these resolvers to identify a service requesting a proxy granting ticket. 
			| In the default configuration, it is the HttpBasedServiceCredentialsToPrincipalResolver that serves this purpose. 
			| You will need to change this list if you are identifying services by something more or other than their callback URL.
