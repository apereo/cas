# DynamoDb Service Registry

Stores registered service data in a [DynamoDb](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) instance.

Support is enabled by adding the following module into the Maven overlay:

```xml
<dependency>
     <groupId>org.apereo.cas</groupId>
     <artifactId>cas-server-support-dynamodb-service-registry</artifactId>
     <version>${cas.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Configuration

You will need to provide CAS with your [AWS credentials](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). Also, to gain a better understanding
of DynamoDb's core components and concepts, please [start with this guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html) first. To see the relevant list of CAS properties, please [review this guide](Configuration-Properties.html#dynamodb-service-registry).

## Troubleshooting

To enable additional logging, configure the log4j configuration file to add the following levels:

```xml
...
<AsyncLogger name="com.amazonaws" level="debug" additivity="false">
    <AppenderRef ref="console"/>
    <AppenderRef ref="file"/>
</AsyncLogger>
...
```


## Auto Initialization

Upon startup and if the services registry database is blank,
the registry is able to auto initialize itself from default
JSON service definitions available to CAS.

To see the relevant list of CAS properties, please [review this guide](Configuration-Properties.html#service-registry).
