# Logout and Single Logout (SLO)

There are potentially many active application sessions during a CAS single sign-on session, and the distinction between
logout and single logout is based on the number of sessions that are ended upon a _logout_ operation. The scope of logout
is determined by where the action takes place:

1. Application logout - ends a single application session
2. CAS logout - ends the CAS SSO session

Note that the logout action in each case has no effect on the other in the simple case. Ending an application session
does not end the CAS session and ending the CAS session does not affect application sessions. This is a common cause of
confusion for new users and deployers of an SSO system.

The single logout support in CAS attempts to reconcile the disparity between CAS logout and application logout. When
CAS is configured for SLO, it attempts to send logout messages to every application that requested authentication to
CAS during the SSO session. While this is a best-effort process, in many cases it works well and provides a consistent
user experience by creating symmetry between login and logout.

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>SSO Sessions</strong><p>It is possible to review the current collection of active SSO sessions,
and determine if CAS itself maintains an active SSO session via the <a href="Monitoring-Statistics.html">CAS administration panels.</a></p></div>


## CAS Logout

Per the [CAS Protocol](../protocol/CAS-Protocol.html), the `/logout` endpoint is responsible for destroying the current SSO session.
Upon logout, it may also be desirable to redirect back to a service. This is controlled via specifying the redirect
link via the `service` parameter. The specified `service` must be registered in the service registry of CAS and enabled and
CAS must be allowed to follow service redirects.

To see the relevant list of CAS properties, please [review this guide](Configuration-Properties.html#logout).

## Single Logout (SLO)

CAS is designed to support single sign out: it means that it will be able to invalidate client application sessions in addition to its own SSO session.  
Whenever a ticket-granting ticket is explicitly expired, the logout protocol will be initiated. Clients that do not support the
logout protocol may notice extra requests in their access logs that appear not to do anything.

<div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Usage Warning!</strong><p>Single Logout is turned on by default.</p></div>

When a CAS session ends, it notifies each of the services that the SSO session is no longer valid, and that relying parties
need to invalidate their own session. Remember that the callback submitted to each CAS-protected application is simply
a notification; nothing more. It is the **responsibility of the application** to intercept that notification and properly
destroy the user authentication session, either manually, via a specific endpoint or more commonly via a CAS client library that supports SLO.

Also note that since SLO is a global event, all applications that have an authentication record with CAS will by default be
contacted, and this may disrupt user experience negatively if those applications are individually distinct from each other.
As an example, if user has logged into a portal application and an email application, logging out of one through SLO will
also destroy the user session in the other which could mean data loss if the application is not carefully managing its session and user activity.

To see the relevant list of CAS properties, please [review this guide](Configuration-Properties.html#single-logout).

### Back Channel

CAS sends an HTTP POST message directly to the service. This is the traditional way of performing notification to the service.

### Front Channel

CAS issues asynchronous AJAX `POST` logout requests via `JSONP` to authenticated services.
The expected behaviour of the CAS client is to invalidate the application web session.

## SLO Requests

The way the notification is done (_back_ or _front_ channel) is configured at a service level
through the `logoutType` property. This value is set to `LogoutType.BACK_CHANNEL` by default. The message is
delivered or the redirection is sent to the URL presented in the _service_ parameter of the original CAS protocol ticket request.

A sample SLO message:

```xml
<samlp:LogoutRequest
    xmlns:samlp="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol"
    xmlns:saml="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion"
    ID="[RANDOM ID]"
    Version="2.0"
    IssueInstant="[CURRENT DATE/TIME]">
    <saml:NameID>@NOT_USED@</saml:NameID>
    <samlp:SessionIndex>[SESSION IDENTIFIER]</samlp:SessionIndex>
</samlp:LogoutRequest>
```

The session identifier is the CAS service ticket ID that was provided to the service when it originally authenticated
to CAS. The session identifier is used to correlate a CAS session with an application session; for example, the SLO
session identifier maps to a servlet session that can subsequently be destroyed to terminate the application session.

### Turning Off Single Logout

To see the relevant list of CAS properties, please [review this guide](Configuration-Properties.html#single-logout).

### Single Logout Per Service

Registered applications with CAS have the option to control single logout behavior individually via
the [Service Management](Service-Management.html) component. Each registered service in the service registry will include configuration
that describes how to the logout request should be submitted. This behavior is controlled via the `logoutType` property
which allows to specify whether the logout request should be submitted via back/front channel or turned off for this application.

Sample configuration follows:

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.RegexRegisteredService",
  "serviceId" : "testId",
  "name" : "testId",
  "id" : 1,
  "logoutType" : "BACK_CHANNEL"
}
```

### Service Endpoint for Logout Requests

By default, logout requests are submitted to the original service id collected at the time of authentication.
CAS has the option to submit such requests to a specific service endpoint that is different
from the original service id, and of course can be configured on a per-service level. This is useful in
cases where the application that is integrated with CAS
does not exactly use a CAS client that supports intercepting such requests and instead, exposes a
different endpoint for its logout operations.

To configure a service specific endpoint, try the following example:

```json
{
  "@class" : "org.apereo.cas.services.RegexRegisteredService",
  "serviceId" : "testId",
  "name" : "testId",
  "id" : 1,
  "logoutType" : "BACK_CHANNEL",
  "logoutUrl" : "https://web.application.net/logout"
}
```

### Asynchronous SLO Messages

By default, backchannel logout messages are sent to endpoint in an asynchronous fashion.
This behavior can be modified via CAS settings. To see the relevant list of CAS properties, please [review this guide](Configuration-Properties.html#logout).

## SSO Session vs. Application Session

In order to better understand the SSO session management of CAS and how it regards application sessions,
one important note is to be first and foremost considered:

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>CAS is NOT a session manager</strong><p>Application session is the responsibility of the application.</p></div>

CAS wants to maintain and control the SSO session in the form of
the `TicketGrantingTicket` and a TGT id which is shared between the
user-agent and the CAS server in the form of a secure cookie.

CAS is not an application session manager in that it is the
responsibility of the applications to maintain and control their own
application sessions.  Once authentication is completed, CAS is
typically out of the picture in terms of the application sessions. Therefore, the expiration policy
of the application session itself is entirely independent of CAS and may be loosely coordinated
and adjusted depending on the ideal user experience in the event that the application session expires.

In the event that Single Logout is not activated, typically, application may expose a logout endpoint in order to destroy the session and next, redirect
the agent to the CAS `logout` endpoint in order to completely destroy the SSO session as well.

Here's a brief diagram that demonstrates various application session configuration and interactions with CAS:
