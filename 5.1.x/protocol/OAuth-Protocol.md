title: CAS - OAuth Protocol

# OAuth Protocol
You can configure the CAS server with:

* [OAuth client support](../integration/Delegate-Authentication.html), which means authentication can be delegated 
through a link on the login page to a CAS, OpenID or OAuth provider. 
* [OAuth server support](../installation/OAuth-OpenId-Authentication.html), which means you will be able to 
communicate with your CAS server through the [OAuth 2.0 protocol](http://oauth.net/2/).
