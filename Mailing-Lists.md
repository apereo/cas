# Mailing Lists

The CAS project has a number of topical mailing lists (now under the apereo.org domain) that are available to obtain support or participate in CAS
development.

It's important to note that, while CAS has an international audience, discussion takes place in English.
The community is very understanding of non-native English speakers and generally exercises patience and persistence
in those circumstances. _Please post in English._


## CAS Community List (cas-user@apereo.org)

_Focus_: support, troubleshooting, general questions.

Post to this list if you have a question about installing, configuring, or troubleshooting CAS.

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>List Etiquette</strong><p>If your question does not contain enough data and is described in vague terms, it will likely be ignored. Please try to be as precise as possible.</p></div>

### Data, Data, Data

Always ensure you have enough diagnostics data in your report:

- Have you reported the **exact CAS version numbers** that exhibit the seemingly-faulty behavior? 
- Have you described your deployment/development environment in enough detail? 
- Have you included error logs, **debug logs**, screenshots and other useful snippets of your configuration to demonstrate the issue? 
- Have you included steps to explain how one might duplicate the problem? 
- Have you prepared unit tests to recreate the issue?
- Have you prepared an overlay project that might allow the project to duplicate the issue? 

Please remember:

> "It doesn't work" doesn't work. Share as much information as possible.

Put another way; readers of your case aren’t necessarily housed in your head! They don’t know what you know. Help them out. Would you want to respond to your own report?

### Be Patient

Once you have posted to a mailing list, please be patient and allow members to read your post and respond. Messages submitted in quick succession or to multiple mailing lists at the same time will eventually be considered spam by the mail server and the sender will be blocked. Remember that all activity on the mailing list is **entirely voluntary**. There are no SLAs. If you find the mailing list responses are not quick enough, you may seek [other options for support](/cas/Support.html).

If you find that your messages are not reaching the mailing list in due time, please contact the project members and/or Apereo to resolve the issue.

### Get Curious

Research the issue and be sure to do your due diligence:

- Have you scanned the web archives for similar cases? 
- Have you looked at the project’s documentation to find better explanations? 
- Have you reviewed the project’s mailing lists, chatrooms and other facilities to find possible solutions? 
- Have you considered upgrading to the latest maintenance release to see if the problem has been fixed?
- Have you looked at `DEBUG` logs to see if the software can offer an explanation?

### Contribute

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Remember</strong><p>If you have already identified an enhancement or a bug, it is <strong>STRONGLY</strong> recommended that you simply submit a pull request to address the case. There is no need for special ceremony to create separate issues. The pull request <strong>IS</strong> the issue and it will be tracked and tagged as such.</p></div>

If you can, [always volunteer to post a patch](/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html) and work up a solution. Be prepared to follow up to test the produced patch in your environment and always try to provide a confirmation. Simply complaining about something and letting it sit in the issue tracker for someone else to handle isn't going to get you much. If you find something that you deem worth someone else's time to fix for you, be sure to demonstrate the issue is first and foremost worth your own time as well. “It ain’t a problem for me if it ain’t a problem for you”, sort of thing.

## CAS Developer List (cas-dev@apereo.org)

The developer list is used by CAS committers to discuss CAS development. It's a suitable forum for discussing feature
requests, software design, and offering contributions. 


<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>List Etiquette</strong><p>Please <b>do not</b> post support questions to the developer list. Your question will most likely be ignored.</p></div>
