# Mailing Lists

The CAS project has a number of topical mailing lists (now under the apereo.org domain) that are available to obtain support or participate in CAS
development.

It's important to note that, while CAS has an international audience, discussion takes place in English.
The community is very understanding of non-native English speakers and generally exercises patience and persistence
in those circumstances. _Please post in English._


## CAS Community List (cas-user)
_Focus_: support, troubleshooting, general questions.

Post to this list if you have a question about installing, configuring, or troubleshooting CAS.

### Data, Data, Data

Always ensure you have enough diagnostics data in your report. Are you reporting the exact version numbers that exhibit the seemingly-faulty behavior? Have you described your deployment/development environment in enough detail? Have you included error logs, screenshots and other useful snippets of your configuration to demonstrate the issue? Have you included steps to explain how one might duplicate the problem? Unit tests to recreate the issue?

Put another way; readers of your case aren’t necessarily housed in your head! They don’t know what you know. Help them out. Would you want to respond to your own report? Think about that before you press submit.

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>List Etiquette</strong><p>If your question does not contain enough data, and is described in vague terms, it will likely be ignored. Please try to be as precise as possible.</p></div>


### Is this a bug?

Research the issue and be sure to do your due diligence. Have you scanned the web archives for similar cases? Have you looked at the project’s documentation to find better explanations? Have you reviewed the project’s mailing lists, chatrooms and other facilities to find possible solutions?

### Should I submit?

CAS considers its issue tracking system as a placeholder to track genuine traceable issues and tasks. If you have a general question about the workings of the software, or if you’re unsure how something is supposed to work and are in need of an analysis and further discussion, consider choosing alternative vessels for contact. Use mailing lists, Gitter, Stackoverflow and other similar tools to engage with the project owners. When the dust has settled and you have arrived at a legitimate theory to explain the root cause of the problem, file a submission.

### Be part of the solution

If you can, always volunteer to post a patch and work up a solution. Be prepared to follow up to test the produced patch in your environment and always try to provide a confirmation. Simply complaining about something and letting it sit in the issue tracker for someone else to handle isn't going to get you much.

If you find something that you deem worth someone else's time to fix for you, be sure to demonstrate the issue is first and foremost worth your own time as well. “It ain’t a problem for me if it ain’t a problem for you”, sort of thing.

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>List Etiquette</strong><p>Unless explicitly asked, please <b>avoid</b> contacting individual project members directly.</p></div>


## CAS Developer List (cas-dev)

_Focus_: CAS developer discussion and collaboration.

The developer list is used by CAS committers to discuss CAS development. It's a suitable forum for discussing feature
requests, software design, and offering contributions. 


<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>List Etiquette</strong><p>Please <b>do not</b> post support questions to the developer list. Your question will most likely be ignored.</p></div>
