# What happened? 

Please note that this patch is targeted at a CAS branch that is no longer maintained, and has reached end of life, and as such cannot be accepted or merged. There will be no follow-up patch releases for this particular release line. If you are unable to upgrade to a community-supported CAS release, you can always keep the patch for your own deployment as a custom change. If you are interested in support options for your CAS deployment beyond free support options, visit [support options](https://apereo.github.io/cas/Support.html).

For additional details, please review the [maintenance policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Maintenance-Policy.html).
      
As ever, we strongly recommend that you take advantage of the CAS release candidates as they come out, and start early to test changes and upgrades to save time and stay ahead of the release schedule. Waiting for a GA release and stating late well after a release is made public is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises and cost you time. Note that CAS releases are strictly time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.
