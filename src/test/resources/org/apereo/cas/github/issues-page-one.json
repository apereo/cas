Instead add it to spring-boot specific tasks only, like BootRunTask.\r\nThe reason is when I have my custom Gradle plugin which also uses spring-boot plugin, and where I have my own JavaExec task, e.g. for generating additional sources, I don't want my task to depend on spring-boot findMainClass, which would create circular dependency, because I want to hook my task as a dependency of compileJava task.\r\n\r\nInstead of the code in RunPluginFeatures (around line 60) which looks like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nif (task instanceof JavaExec || task instanceof CreateStartScripts) {\r\n    task.dependsOn(FIND_MAIN_CLASS_TASK_NAME);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd rather propose to change it to something like this:\r\n```java\r\nif (task instanceof BootRunTask || task instanceof CreateStartScripts) {\r\n    task.dependsOn(FIND_MAIN_CLASS_TASK_NAME);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks!"
