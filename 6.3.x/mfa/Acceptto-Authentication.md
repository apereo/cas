# Acceptto Authentication

Secure your workforce identity with [Acceptto](https://www.acceptto.com) 
end-to-end risk-based multiFactor authentication.

Start by visiting the [Acceptto documentation](https://www.acceptto.com/acceptto-mfa-rest-api/).

Support is enabled by including the following module in the overlay:

```xml
<dependency>
     <groupId>org.apereo.cas</groupId>
     <artifactId>cas-server-support-acceptto-mfa</artifactId>
     <version>${cas.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

The integration adds support for both multifactor authentication and QR passwordless authentication.

## Integration with DBFP

The integration is able to handle the integration with DBFP and will set a cookie named `jwt` that is passed to the Acceptto API. This parameter contains a value that the server uses to assess the risk of authentication request including browser fingerprint, IP address of user and GPS location of the userâ€™s browser. The server compares this data with the history of user behavior data to detect anomalies.

## Configuration
