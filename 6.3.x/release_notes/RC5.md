# RC5 Release Notes

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set 
you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS 
releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain 
confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with 
release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

## Apereo Membership

If you benefit from Apereo CAS as free and open-source software, we 
invite you to [join the Apereo Foundation](https://www.apereo.org/content/apereo-membership) 
and financially support the project at a capacity that best suits your deployment. Note that all development activity 
is performed *almost exclusively* on a voluntary basis with no expectations, commitments or strings attached. Having the financial means to better 
sustain engineering activities will allow the developer community to allocate *dedicated and committed* time for long-term support, 
maintenance and release planning, especially when it comes to addressing critical and security issues in a timely manner. Funding will 
ensure support for the software you rely on and you gain an advantage and say in the way Apereo, and the CAS project at that, runs 
and operates. If you consider your CAS deployment to be a critical part of the identity and access 
management ecosystem, this is a viable option to consider.

## Get Involved

- Start your CAS deployment today. Try out features and [share feedback](/cas/Mailing-Lists.html).
- Better yet, [contribute patches](/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html).
- Suggest and apply documentation improvements.

## New & Noteworthy

The following items are new improvements and enhancements presented in this release.

### Puppeteer Tests

Documentation is now available to highlight [test processes](../developer/Test-Process.html) used by the 
CAS project and developers/contributors. The newest addition is the availability of functional/browser testing 
mechanisms that are backed by the Puppeteer framework. The test scenarios that are designed are 
executed by the CAS continuous integration system and will be improved over time
to account for advanced use cases such as ensuring protocol compatibility and other variations of the authentication webflow.  

### Apple Signin

[Delegated authentication](../integration/Delegate-Authentication.html) can now hand off 
authentication requests to [sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/).

### WebAuthN for Primary Authentication

[WebAuthn FIDO2](../mfa/FIDO2-WebAuthn-Authentication.html) multifactor authentication 
can now, optionally, act as a standalone factor for primary authentication, for user accounts 
and devices that have an existing registration record with CAS.

### Duo Security Universal Prompt

Support for Duo Security's [Universal Prompt](../mfa/DuoSecurity-Authentication.html) for multifactor authentication is now available.

### QR Code Authentication

[QR Code authentication](../installation/QRCode-Authentication.html) is a strategy that allows the user to scan a QR code, generated by the
CAS server, using a mobile device and subsequently login after having successfully validated it.

### WebAuthN LDAP Repository

[WebAuthn FIDO2](../mfa/FIDO2-WebAuthn-Authentication.html) multifactor authentication 
can now, manage and track device registration records inside LDAP directories.

### Test Coverage

CAS test coverage across all modules in the codebase has now reached `90%` and continues to climb. Additional validation rules are also applied to fail all pull requests that fall below this threshold. 

## Other Stuff

- [Attribute resolution](../integration/Attribute-Resolution.html) has gained a new option to force all attribute repositories to produce data and short-circuit the resolution logic if any repository fails to resolve the person details.
- [Maven repositories](https://spring.io/blog/2020/10/29/notice-of-permissions-changes-to-repo-spring-io-fall-and-winter-2020) managed by the Spring project are removed from the CAS gradle build. 
- Improvements to [password management](../password_management/Password-Management.html) flows to handle invalid tokens more gracefully, and allow password reset with or without single sign-on sessions.
- Releasing attributes with a space in the attribute name, due to misconfiguration, will force CAS to replace the space with `_` upon release.
- Loading Kerberos and JAAS configuration files for [SPNEGO authentication](../installation/SPNEGO-Authentication.html) is changed to use Spring resources for syntax. You may need to ensure paths in the CAS configuration start with the `file:` prefix.
- [Attribute resolution](../integration/Attribute-Resolution.html) for LDAP has been improved to support fetching and mapping attributes with tags/options.
- All external links found in the CAS documentation are corrected to point to valid resources. Validation processes are also adjusted to prevent bad links.
