	<description>
	Assignment of expiration policies for the different tickets generated by CAS including ticket granting ticket (TGT), service ticket (ST), proxy granting ticket (PGT), and proxy ticket (PT).
	These expiration policies determine how long the ticket they are assigned to can be used and even how often they can be used before becoming expired / invalid.
