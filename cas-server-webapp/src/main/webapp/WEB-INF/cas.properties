# Single Sign-On Session Timeouts
# Defaults sourced from WEB-INF/spring-configuration/ticketExpirationPolices.xml
#
# Maximum session timeout - TGT will expire in maxTimeToLiveInSeconds regardless of usage

# Idle session timeout -  TGT will expire sooner than maxTimeToLiveInSeconds if no further requests
# for STs occur within timeToKillInSeconds

##
# Service Ticket Timeout
# Default sourced from WEB-INF/spring-configuration/ticketExpirationPolices.xml
#
# Service Ticket timeout - typically kept short as a control against replay attacks, default is 10s.  You'll want to
# increase this timeout if you are manually testing service ticket creation/validation via tamperdata or similar tools
# st.timeToKillInSeconds=10

# Log4j
# Default sourced from WEB-INF/spring-configuration/log4jConfiguration.xml:
#
# It is often time helpful to externalize log4j.xml to a system path to preserve settings between upgrades.
# e.g. log4j.config.location=/etc/cas/log4j.xml
# log4j.config.location=classpath:log4j.xml
