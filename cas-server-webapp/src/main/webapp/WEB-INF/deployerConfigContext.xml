	| This file declares some of the Spring-managed JavaBeans that make up a CAS deployment.  
	| The beans declared in this file are instantiated at context initialization time by the Spring

	|
	| By far the most common change you will need to make in this file is to change the last bean
	| declaration to replace the default SimpleTestUsernamePasswordAuthenticationHandler with
	| one implementing your approach for authenticating usernames and passwords.

			| attempting to authenticate to CAS /login .  In the default configuration, it is the DefaultCredentialsToPrincipalResolver
			| that fills this role.  If you are using some other kind of credentials than UsernamePasswordCredentials, you will need to replace
			| DefaultCredentialsToPrincipalResolver with a CredentialsToPrincipalResolver that supports the credentials you are
			| using.
			|
			| Second, AuthenticationManagerImpl uses these resolvers to identify a service requesting a proxy granting ticket. 
			| In the default configuration, it is the HttpBasedServiceCredentialsToPrincipalResolver that serves this purpose.
