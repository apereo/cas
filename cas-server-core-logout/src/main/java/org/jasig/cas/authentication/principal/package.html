<p>Credentials is a marker interface for an opaque object that may be recognized by
Handlers and Resolvers. Credentials may be a Userid/Password, Certificate,
RemoteUser, IP address, etc.</p>
<p>When the simple AuthenticationManagerImpl is
used, that bean is configured with a list of AuthenticationHandlers that
validate Credentials and CredentialsToPrincipalResolvers that turn Credentials
into Principal objects.</p>
<p>The Authentication Handler validates Credentials but does not extract
information. This seems curious in the simple case when the credential are a
Userid/Password. It becomes clearer for a Certificate. A Certificate is valid if
you trust the CA, if it hasn't expired, and if it isn't revoked. You can decide
all this, and still not have the foggiest idea what ID to give to the person (if
it is a person) reprepsented by the Certificate.</p>
<p>The CredentialsToPrincipalResolver looks into previously validated
Credentials to construct a Principal object containing an ID (and in more
complex cases some attributes). The DefaultCredentialsToPrincipalResolver takes
UsernamePasswordCredentials and creates a SimplePrincipal containing the Userid.</p>
