# Simple Multifactor Authentication

Allow CAS to act as a multifactor authentication provider on its own, issuing tokens and sending them to end-users via pre-defined communication
channels such as email or text messages. Tokens issued by CAS are tracked using the [ticket registry](../ticketing/Configuring-Ticketing-Components.html)
and are assigned a configurable expiration policy controlled via CAS settings.

## Configuration

Support is enabled by including the following module in the overlay:

```xml
<dependency>
     <groupId>org.apereo.cas</groupId>
     <artifactId>cas-server-support-simple-mfa</artifactId>
     <version>${cas.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

To see the relevant list of CAS properties, please [review this guide](../configuration/Configuration-Properties.html#simple-multifactor-authentication).

## Registration

Registration is expected to have occurred as an out-of-band process. Ultimately, CAS expects to fetch the necessary attributes
from configured attribute sources to determine communications channels for email and/or sms. The adopter is expected to have populated
user records with enough information to indicate a phone number and/or email address where CAS could then be configured to fetch and
examine those attributes to share generated tokens.

## Communication Strategy

Users may be notified of CAS-issued tokens via text messages and/or email. The authenticated CAS principal is expected to carry enough attributes, 
configurable via CAS settings, in order for CAS to properly send text messages and/or email to the end-user.

To learn more about available options, please [see this guide](../notifications/SMS-Messaging-Configuration.html) 
or [this guide](../notifications/Sending-Email-Configuration.html).
