## Introduction

Welcome to the home of the [Central Authentication Service project][apereocas], more commonly referred to as CAS. CAS is an
enterprise multilingual identity provider and single sign-on solution for the web and attempts to 
be a comprehensive platform for your authentication and authorization needs.

CAS is an open and well-documented authentication protocol. The primary implementation of the protocol is an open-source Java server
component by the same name hosted here, with support for a plethora of additional authentication protocols and features such as SAML2, OpenID Connect, MFA 
and many many more.
