## Introduction

Welcome to the home of the [Central Authentication Service project](https://www.apereo.org/cas), more commonly referred to as CAS. CAS is an
enterprise multilingual single sign-on solution for the web and attempts to be a comprehensive platform for your authentication and authorization needs.

CAS is an open and well-documented authentication protocol. The primary implementation of the protocol is an open-source Java server
component by the same name hosted here, with support for a plethora of additional authentication protocols and features.
