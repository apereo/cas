/**
 * An implementation of {@link UniqueTicketIdGenerator} that is able auto-configure
 * the suffix based on the underlying host name.
 * <p>In order to assist with multi-node deployments, in scenarios where CAS configuration
 * and specially {@code application.properties} file is externalized, it would be ideal to just have one set
 * of configuration files for all nodes, such that there would for instance be one {@code application.properties} file
 * for all nodes. This would remove the need to copy/sync config files over across nodes, again in a
 * situation where they are externalized.
 * <p>The drawback is that in keeping only one {@code application.properties} file, we'd lose the ability
 * to define unique {@code host.name} property values for each node as the suffix, which would assist with troubleshooting
 * and diagnostics. To provide a remedy, this ticket generator is able to retrieve the {@code host.name} value directly from
 * the actual node name, rather than relying on the configuration, only if one isn't specified in
 * the {@code application.properties} file. </p>
