/**
 * Describes a one-time-password credential that contains an optional unique identifier and required password.
 * The primary difference between this component and {@link UsernamePasswordCredential} is that the username/ID is optional
 * in the former and requisite in the latter.
 * <p>
 * This class implements {@link CredentialMetaData} since the one-time-password is safe for long-term storage after
 * authentication. Note that metadata is stored only _after_ authentication, at which time the OTP has already
 * been consumed and by definition is no longer useful for authentication.
