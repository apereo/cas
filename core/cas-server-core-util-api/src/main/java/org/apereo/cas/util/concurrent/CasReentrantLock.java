/**
 * This is {@link CasReentrantLock}.
 * <p>
 * When a method is synchronized, only one thread would be allowed to enter that method at a time.
 * If you are using a virtual thread in this scenario, when the thread is moved to BLOCKED state,
 * ideally it should relinquish its control of the underlying OS thread and move back to the heap memory.
 * However in the current virtual thread implementation, when a virtual thread gets
 * BLOCKED because of synchronized method (or block), it will not relinquish its control over the underlying
 * OS thread. Thus, you would not gain the benefits of switching to virtual threads.
 * <p>
 * The following components provides an alternative to synchronized locking with {@link ReentrantLock}.
