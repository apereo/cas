/**
 * This is {@link RoutingFunctionEnvironmentPostProcessor}.
 * This is a modest copy of the original class found in Spring Cloud Function
 * that removes an unnecessary cast to {@link org.springframework.core.env.StandardEnvironment}.
 * The environment that is passed, in case Spring Cloud Bootstrap is defined, is
 * one that cannot be cast down to {@link org.springframework.core.env.StandardEnvironment} directly
 * and the cast generally is not needed.
 * We have no use for this class in CAS, and yet we cannot disable it using any other way
 * since it's directly defined in Spring Cloud Function's {@code spring.factories} file.
