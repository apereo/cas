# OpenID Connect Protocol

You can configure the CAS server with:

* [OIDC client support](../integration/Delegate-Authentication.html), which means authentication can be delegated through a link on the 
login page to OpenID Connect provider. 
* [OIDC server support](../installation/OIDC-Authentication.html), which means you will be able to communicate with your CAS server 
through the [OpenID Connect protocol](http://openid.net/connect/), having CAS act as an OP.
