**1. Introduction**
===================

This is the official specification of the CAS 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 protocols.

The Central Authentication Service (CAS) is a single-sign-on / single-sign-off protocol
for the web.
It permits a user to access multiple applications while providing their
credentials (such as userid and password) only once to a central CAS Server
application.

**1.1. Conventions & Definitions**
----------------------------------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119[1](<#1>).

-   "Client" refers to the end user and/or the web browser.

-   "CAS Client" refers to the software component that is integrated with a web
    application and interacts with the CAS server via CAS protocol.

-   "Server" refers to the Central Authentication Service server.

-   "Service" refers to the application the client is trying to access.

-   "Back-end service" refers to the application a service is trying to access
    on behalf of a client. This can also be referred to as the "target service."

-   "SSO" refers to Single Sign on.

-   "SLO" refers to Single Logout.

-   "<LF>" is a bare line feed (ASCII value 0x0a).

**2. CAS URIs**
===============

CAS is an HTTP[2](<#2>),[3](<#3>)-based protocol that requires each of its
components to be accessible through specific URIs. This section will discuss
each of the URIs:

| URI                               | Description
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
| `/login`                          | credential requestor / acceptor
| `/logout`                         | destroy CAS session (logout)
| `/validate`                       | service ticket validation
| `/serviceValidate`                | service ticket validation [CAS 2.0]
| `/proxyValidate`                  | service/proxy ticket validation [CAS 2.0]
| `/proxy`                          | proxy ticket service [CAS 2.0]
| `/p3/serviceValidate`             | service ticket validation [CAS 3.0]
| `/p3/proxyValidate`               | service/proxy ticket validation [CAS 3.0]

<a name="head2.1"/>

**2.1. /login as credential requestor**
---------------------------------------

The `/login` URI operates with two behaviors: as a credential requestor, and as
a credential acceptor. It responds to credentials by acting as a credential
acceptor and otherwise acts as a credential requestor.

If the client has already established a single sign-on session with CAS, the
web browser presents to CAS a secure cookie containing a string identifying
a ticket-granting ticket. This cookie is called the ticket-granting cookie.
If the ticket-granting cookie keys to a valid ticket-granting ticket, CAS MAY
issue a service ticket provided all the other conditions in this specification
are met.
See Section [3.6](<#head3.6>) for more information on ticket-granting cookies.

<a name="head2.1.1"/>

### **2.1.1. parameters**

The following HTTP request parameters may be passed to `/login` while it is
acting as a credential requestor. They are all case-sensitive, and they all
MUST be handled by `/login`.

-   `service` [OPTIONAL] - the identifier of the application the client is
    trying to access. In almost all cases, this will be the URL of the
    application. As a HTTP request parameter, this URL value MUST be
    URL-encoded as described in section 2.2 of RFC 3986 [[4](<#4>)].
    If a `service` is not specified and a single sign-on session does not yet
    exist, CAS SHOULD request credentials from the user to initiate a single
    sign-on session. If a `service` is not specified and a single sign-on
    session already exists, CAS SHOULD display a message notifying the client
    that it is already logged in.

    > Note: It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that all `service` urls be filtered via
    > the service management tool, such that only authorized and known
    > client applications would be able to use the CAS server.
    > Leaving the service management tool open to allow lenient access to
    > all applications will potentially increase the risk of service attacks
    > and other security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that
    > only secure protocols such as `https` be allowed for client applications
    > for further strengthen the authenticating client.

-   `renew` [OPTIONAL] - if this parameter is set, single sign-on will be
    bypassed. In this case, CAS will require the client to present credentials
    regardless of the existence of a single sign-on session with CAS. This
    parameter is not compatible with the `gateway` parameter. Services
    redirecting to the `/login` URI and login form views posting to the `/login`
    URI SHOULD NOT set both the `renew` and `gateway` request parameters.
    Behavior is undefined if both are set. It is RECOMMENDED that CAS
    implementations ignore the `gateway` parameter if `renew` is set.
    It is RECOMMENDED that when the `renew` parameter is set its value be "true".

-   `gateway` [OPTIONAL] - if this parameter is set, CAS will not ask the client
    for credentials. If the client has a pre-existing single sign-on session
    with CAS, or if a single sign-on session can be established through
    non-interactive means (i.e. trust authentication), CAS MAY redirect the
    client to the URL specified by the `service` parameter, appending a valid
    service ticket. (CAS also MAY interpose an advisory page informing the
    client that a CAS authentication has taken place.) If the client does not
    have a single sign-on session with CAS, and a non-interactive authentication
    cannot be established, CAS MUST redirect the client to the URL specified by
    the `service` parameter with no "ticket" parameter appended to the URL. If
    the `service` parameter is not specified and `gateway` is set, the behavior
    of CAS is undefined. It is RECOMMENDED that in this case, CAS request
    credentials as if neither parameter was specified. This parameter is not
    compatible with the `renew` parameter. Behavior is undefined if both are
    set. It is RECOMMENDED that when the `gateway` parameter is set its value be
    "true".

-   `method` [OPTIONAL, CAS 3.0] - The `method` to be used when sending responses.
    While native HTTP redirects (`GET`) may be utilized as the default method,
    applications that require a `POST` response can use this parameter to indicate
    the method type. A `HEADER` method may also be specified
    to indicate the CAS final response such as `service` and `ticket`should be returned 
    in form of HTTP response headers.  It is up to the CAS server implementation to determine
    whether or not `POST` or `HEADER` responses are supported.

### **2.1.2. URL examples of /login**

Simple login example:

`https://cas.example.org/cas/login?service=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.org%2Fservice`

Don't prompt for username/password:

`https://cas.example.org/cas/login?service=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.org%2Fservice&gateway=true`

Always prompt for username/password:

`https://cas.example.org/cas/login?service=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.org%2Fservice&renew=true`

Use POST responses instead of redirects:

`https://cas.example.org/cas/login?method=POST&service=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.org%2Fservice`

<a name="head2.1.3"/>

### **2.1.3. response for username/password authentication**

When `/login` behaves as a credential requestor, the response will vary depending
on the type of credentials it is requesting. In most cases, CAS will respond by
displaying a login screen requesting a username and password. This page MUST
include a form with the parameters, "username", "password", and "lt". The form
MAY also include the parameter "warn". If `service` was specified to `/login`,
`service` MUST also be a parameter of the form, containing the value originally
passed to `/login`. These parameters are discussed in detail in Section [2.2.1](#head2.2.1). The
form MUST be submitted through the HTTP POST method to `/login` which will then
act as a credential acceptor, discussed in Section [2.2](#head2.2).

<a name="head2.1.4"/>

### **2.1.4. response for trust authentication**

Trust authentication accommodates consideration of arbitrary aspects of the
request as a basis for authentication. The appropriate user experience for trust
authentication will be highly deployer-specific in consideration of local policy
and of the logistics of the particular authentication mechanism implemented.

When `/login` behaves as a credential requestor for trust authentication, its
behavior will be determined by the type of credentials it will be receiving. If
the credentials are valid, CAS MAY transparently redirect the user to the
service. Alternately, CAS MAY display a warning that credentials were presented
and allow the client to confirm that it wants to use those credentials. It is
RECOMMENDED that CAS implementations allow the deployer to choose the preferred
behavior. If the credentials are invalid or non-existent, it is RECOMMENDED that
CAS displays to the client the reason why authentication failed, and possibly present
the user with alternate means of authentication (e.g. username/password
authentication).

<a name="head2.1.5"/>

### **2.1.5. response for single sign-on authentication**

If the client has already established a single sign-on session with CAS, the
client will have presented its HTTP session cookie to `/login` and behavior will
be handled as in Section [2.2.4](#head2.2.4). However, if the `renew` parameter
is set, the behavior will be handled as in Section [2.1.3](#head2.1.3) or
[2.1.4](#head2.1.4).

<a name="head2.2"/>

**2.2. /login as credential acceptor**
--------------------------------------

When a set of accepted credentials are passed to `/login`, `/login` acts as a
credential acceptor and its behavior is defined in this Section.

<a name="head2.2.1"/>

### **2.2.1. parameters common to all types of authentication**

The following HTTP request parameters MAY be passed to `/login` while it is acting
as a credential acceptor. They are all case-sensitive and they all MUST be
handled by `/login`.

-   `service` [OPTIONAL] - the URL of the application the client is trying to
    access. As a HTTP request parameter, this URL value MUST be URL-encoded as
    described in Section 2.2 of RFC 1738 [[4](<#4>)]. CAS MUST redirect the
    client to this URL upon successful authentication. This is discussed in
    detail in Section [2.2.4](#head2.2.4). If the CAS Server operates in
    non-open mode (Service URLs allowed to use the CAS Server are registered
    within the CAS Server), the CAS Server MUST deny operation and print out
    a meaningful message if a non-authorized service URL is presented.

    > Note: It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that all `service` urls be filtered via
    > the service management tool, such that only authorized and known
    > client applications would be able to use the CAS server.
    > Leaving the service management tool open to allow lenient access to
    > all applications will potentially increase the risk of service attacks
    > and other security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that
    > only secure protocols such as `https` be allowed for client applications
    > for further strengthen the authenticating client.

-   `warn` [OPTIONAL] - if this parameter is set, single sign-on MUST NOT be
    transparent. The client MUST be prompted before being authenticated to
    another service.

-   `method` [OPTIONAL] - The `method` to be used when sending responses. See
    section [2.1.1](<#head2.1.1>) for details

<a name="head2.2.2"/>

### **2.2.2. parameters for username/password authentication**

In addition to the OPTIONAL parameters specified in Section [2.2.1](#head2.2.1),
the following HTTP request parameters MUST be passed to `/login` while it is
acting as a credential acceptor for username/password authentication. They are
all case-sensitive.

-   `username` [REQUIRED] - the username of the client that is trying to log in

-   `password` [REQUIRED] - the password of the client that is trying to log in

-   `lt` [OPTIONAL] - a login ticket. This is provided as part of the login form
    discussed in Section [2.1.3](#head2.1.3). The login ticket itself is discussed
    in Section [3.5](#head3.5).

-   `rememberMe` [OPTIONAL, CAS 3.0] - if this parameter is set, a Long-Term
    Ticket Granting Ticket might be created by the CAS server (refered to as
    Remember-Me support). It is subject to the CAS server configuration whether
    Long-Term Ticket Granting Tickets are supported or not.

>   Note: When Long-Term Ticket Granting Tickets (Remember Me) are supported by
>   the CAS Server, security considerations MUST be taken into account. This for
>   example includes shared computer usage. On CAS client systems it might be
>   necessary to handle Remember-Me logins different. See Section
>   [4.1](<#head4.1>) for details.

<a name="head2.2.3"/>

### **2.2.3. parameters for trust authentication**

There are no REQUIRED HTTP request parameters for trust authentication. Trust
authentication MAY be based on any aspect of the HTTP request.

<a name="head2.2.4"/>

### **2.2.4. response**

One of the following responses MUST be provided by `/login` when it is operating
as a credential acceptor.

-   successful login: redirect the client to the URL specified by the `service`
    parameter in a manner that will not cause the client's credentials to be
    forwarded to the `service`. This redirection MUST result in the client issuing
    a GET request to the `service`. The request MUST include a valid service
    ticket, passed as the HTTP request parameter, "ticket". See [Appendix
    B](<#head_appdx_b>) for more information. If `service` was not specified,
    CAS MUST display a message notifying the client that it has successfully
    initiated a single sign-on session.

-   failed login: return to `/login` as a credential requestor. It is RECOMMENDED
    in this case that the CAS server display an error message to the user
    describing why login failed (e.g. bad password, locked account, etc.),
    and if appropriate, provide an opportunity for the user to attempt to
    login again.

<a name="head2.3"/>

**2.3. /logout**
----------------

`/logout` destroys a client's single sign-on CAS session. The ticket-granting
cookie (Section [3.6](#head3.6)) is destroyed, and subsequent requests to `/login` will not
obtain service tickets until the user again presents primary credentials (and
thereby establishes a new single sign-on session).

<a name="head2.3.1"/>

### **2.3.1. parameters**

The following HTTP request parameter MAY be specified to `/logout`. It is case
sensitive and SHOULD be handled by `/logout`.

-   `service` [OPTIONAL, CAS 3.0] - if a `service` parameter is specified, the
    browser might be automatically redirected to the URL specified by `service`
    after the logout was performed by the CAS server. If redirection by the
    CAS Server is actually performed depends on the server configuration.
    As a HTTP request parameter, the `service` value MUST be URL-encoded as
    described in Section 2.2 of RFC 1738 [[4](<#4>)].

    > Note: It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that all `service` urls be filtered via
    > the service management tool, such that only authorized and known
    > client applications would be able to use the CAS server.
    > Leaving the service management tool open to allow lenient access to
    > all applications will potentially increase the risk of service attacks
    > and other security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that
    > only secure protocols such as `https` be allowed for client applications
    > for further strengthen the authenticating client.

    > Note: The `url` parameter defined in the former CAS 2.0 specification is
    > not a valid parameter in CAS 3.0 anymore. CAS Servers MUST ignore given
    > `url` parameters.
    > A CAS client MAY provide the `service` parameter as described above,
    > as this ensures the parameter is validated against the registered service
    > URLs when operating in non-open mode. See [2.3.2](#head2.3.2) for details.

<a name="head2.3.2"/>

### **2.3.2. response**

[CAS 1.0, CAS 2.0] `/logout` MUST display a page stating that the user has been
logged out. If the "url" request parameter is implemented, `/logout` SHOULD also
provide a link to the provided URL as described in Section [2.3.1](#head2.3.1).

[CAS 3.0] `/logout` MUST display a page stating that the user has been logged out
if no `service` parameter was provided. If a `service` request parameter with an
encoded URL value is provided, the CAS server redirects to the given service URL
after successful logout.

>   Note: When CAS Server operates in non-open mode (allowed Service URLs are
>   registered within the CAS Server), the CAS server MUST ensure that only
>   registered [service] parameter Service URLs are accepted for redirection.
>   The `url` parameter defined in the former CAS 2.0 specification is
>   not a valid parameter in CAS 3.0 anymore. CAS Servers MUST ignore given
>   `url` parameters.

<a name="head2.3.3"/>

### **2.3.3 Single Logout**

The CAS Server MAY support Single Logout (SLO). SLO means that the user gets
logged out not only from the CAS Server, but also from all visited CAS client
applications. If SLO is supported by the CAS Server, the CAS Server MUST send a
HTTP POST request containing a logout XML document (see [Appendix
C](<#head_appdx_c>)) to all service URLs provided to CAS during this CAS session
whenever a Ticket Granting Ticket is explicitly expired by the user (e.g. during logout).
CAS Clients that do not support the SLO POST requests MUST ignore these requests.
SLO requests MAY also be initiated by the CAS Server upon TGT idle timeout.



<a name="head2.3.3.1"/>

#### **2.3.3.1 Server behaviour**

The CAS Server SHALL ignore all errors that might occur on a Single Logout POST
request to CAS Client applications service URLs. This ensures that any errors
while sending the POST request do not disturb CAS Server performance and
availability ("fire and forget").



<a name="head2.3.3.2"/>

#### **2.3.3.2 Client behaviour**

Handling the logout POST request data is up to the CAS client. It is RECOMMENDED
to logout the user from the application identified by the service ticket id sent
in the SLO POST request.
If the client supports SLO POST request handling, the client SHALL return a HTTP success
status code.



<a name="head2.4"/>

## **2.4. /validate [CAS 1.0]**

`/validate` checks the validity of a service ticket. `/validate` is part of the CAS
1.0 protocol and thus does not handle proxy authentication. CAS MUST respond
with a ticket validation failure response when a proxy ticket is passed to
`/validate`.



<a name="head2.4.1"/>

### **2.4.1. parameters**

The following HTTP request parameters MAY be specified to `/validate`. They are
case sensitive and MUST all be handled by `/validate`.

-   `service` [REQUIRED] - the identifier of the service for which the ticket was
    issued, as discussed in Section 2.2.1.
    As a HTTP request parameter, the `service` value MUST be URL-encoded as
    described in Section 2.2 of RFC 1738 [[4](<#4>)].

    > Note: It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that all `service` urls be filtered via
    > the service management tool, such that only authorized and known
    > client applications would be able to use the CAS server.
    > Leaving the service management tool open to allow lenient access to
    > all applications will potentially increase the risk of service attacks
    > and other security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that
    > only secure protocols such as `https` be allowed for client applications
    > for further strengthen the authenticating client.

-   `ticket` [REQUIRED] - the service ticket issued by `/login`. Service tickets are
    described in Section 3.1.

-   `renew` [OPTIONAL] - if this parameter is set, ticket validation will only
    succeed if the service ticket was issued from the presentation of the user's
    primary credentials. It will fail if the ticket was issued from a single
    sign-on session.



<a name="head2.4.2"/>

### **2.4.2. response**

`/validate` will return one of the following two responses:

On ticket validation success:

yes<LF>

On ticket validation failure:

no<LF>



<a name="head2.4.3"/>

### **2.4.3. URL examples of /validate**

Simple validation attempt:

`https://cas.example.org/cas/validate?service=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.org%2Fservice&ticket=ST-1856339-aA5Yuvrxzpv8Tau1cYQ7`

Ensure service ticket was issued by presentation of primary credentials:

`https://cas.example.org/cas/validate?service=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.org%2Fservice&ticket=ST-1856339-aA5Yuvrxzpv8Tau1cYQ7&renew=true`



<a name="head2.5"/>

**2.5. /serviceValidate [CAS 2.0]**
-----------------------------------

`/serviceValidate` checks the validity of a service ticket and returns an XML-fragment response.
`/serviceValidate` MUST also generate and issue proxy-granting tickets when requested.
`/serviceValidate` MUST NOT return a successful authentication if it receives a proxy ticket.
It is RECOMMENDED that if `/serviceValidate` receives a proxy ticket, the error message in the XML
response SHOULD explain that validation failed because a proxy ticket was passed
to `/serviceValidate`.



<a name="head2.5.1"/>

### **2.5.1. parameters**

The following HTTP request parameters MAY be specified to `/serviceValidate`. They
are case sensitive and MUST all be handled by `/serviceValidate`.

-   `service` [REQUIRED] - the identifier of the service for which the ticket was
    issued, as discussed in Section [2.2.1](#head2.2.1).
    As a HTTP request parameter, the `service` value MUST be URL-encoded as
    described in Section 2.2 of RFC 1738 [[4](<#4>)].

    > Note: It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that all `service` urls be filtered via
    > the service management tool, such that only authorized and known
    > client applications would be able to use the CAS server.
    > Leaving the service management tool open to allow lenient access to
    > all applications will potentially increase the risk of service attacks
    > and other security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that
    > only secure protocols such as `https` be allowed for client applications
    > for further strengthen the authenticating client.

-   `ticket` [REQUIRED] - the service ticket issued by `/login`. Service tickets are
    described in Section [3.1](#head3.1).

-   `pgtUrl` [OPTIONAL] - the URL of the proxy callback. Discussed in Section
    [2.5.4](#head2.5.4).
    As a HTTP request parameter, the "pgtUrl" value MUST be URL-encoded as
    described in Section 2.2 of RFC 1738 [[4](<#4>)].

-   `renew` [OPTIONAL] - if this parameter is set, ticket validation will only
    succeed if the service ticket was issued from the presentation of the user's
    primary credentials. It will fail if the ticket was issued from a single
    sign-on session.

-   `format` [OPTIONAL] - if this parameter is set, ticket validation response
    MUST be produced based on the parameter value. Supported values are `XML`
    and `JSON`. If this parameter is not set, the default `XML` format will be used.
    If the parameter value is not supported by the CAS server, an error code
    MUST be returned as is described in section [2.5.3](<#head2.5.3>).

<a name="head2.5.2"/>

### **2.5.2. response**

`/serviceValidate` will return an XML-formatted CAS serviceResponse as described
in the XML schema in Appendix A. Below are example responses:

**On ticket validation success:**

```xml
<cas:serviceResponse xmlns:cas="http://www.yale.edu/tp/cas">
 <cas:authenticationSuccess>
  <cas:user>username</cas:user>
  <cas:proxyGrantingTicket>PGTIOU-84678-8a9d...</cas:proxyGrantingTicket>
 </cas:authenticationSuccess>
</cas:serviceResponse>
```


```json
{
  "serviceResponse" : {
    "authenticationSuccess" : {
      "user" : "username",
      "proxyGrantingTicket" : "PGTIOU-84678-8a9d..."
    }
  }
}
```

**On ticket validation failure:**

```xml
<cas:serviceResponse xmlns:cas="http://www.yale.edu/tp/cas">
 <cas:authenticationFailure code="INVALID_TICKET">
    Ticket ST-1856339-aA5Yuvrxzpv8Tau1cYQ7 not recognized
  </cas:authenticationFailure>
</cas:serviceResponse>
```

```json
{
  "serviceResponse" : {
    "authenticationFailure" : {
      "code" : "INVALID_TICKET",
      "description" : "Ticket ST-1856339-aA5Yuvrxzpv8Tau1cYQ7 not recognized"
    }
  }
}
```

For proxy responses, see section [2.6.2](<#head2.6.2>).

<a name="head2.5.3"/>

### **2.5.3. error codes**

The following values MAY be used as the "code" attribute of authentication
failure responses. The following is the minimum set of error codes that all CAS
servers MUST implement. Implementations MAY include others.

-   `INVALID_REQUEST` - not all of the required request parameters were present

-   `INVALID_TICKET_SPEC` - failure to meet the requirements of validation specification

-   `UNAUTHORIZED_SERVICE_PROXY` - the service is not authorized to perform proxy authentication

-   `INVALID_PROXY_CALLBACK` - The proxy callback specified is invalid. The credentials specified
    for proxy authentication do not meet the security requirements

-   `INVALID_TICKET` - the ticket provided was not valid, or the ticket did not
    come from an initial login and `renew` was set on validation. The body of
    the `<cas:authenticationFailure>` block of the XML response SHOULD describe
    the exact details.

-   `INVALID_SERVICE` - the ticket provided was valid, but the service specified
    did not match the service associated with the ticket. CAS MUST invalidate
    the ticket and disallow future validation of that same ticket.

-   `INTERNAL_ERROR` - an internal error occurred during ticket validation

For all error codes, it is RECOMMENDED that CAS provide a more detailed message
as the body of the `<cas:authenticationFailure>` block of the XML response.

<a name="head2.5.4"/>

### **2.5.4. proxy callback**

If a service wishes to proxy a client's authentication to a back-end service, it
must acquire a proxy-granting ticket (PGT). Acquisition of this ticket is handled
through a proxy callback URL. This URL will uniquely and securely identify the
service that is proxying the client's authentication. The back-end service can
then decide whether or not to accept the credentials based on the proxying
service identifying callback URL.

The proxy callback mechanism works as follows:

1.  The service that is requesting a proxy-granting ticket (PGT) specifies upon
    initial service ticket or proxy ticket validation the HTTP request parameter
    "pgtUrl" to `/serviceValidate` (or `/proxyValidate`). This is a callback URL of
    the service to which CAS will connect to verify the service's identity. This
    URL MUST be HTTPS and CAS MUST evaluate the endpoint to establish peer trust.
    Building trust at a minimum involves utilizing PKIX and employing container trust to
    validate the signature, chain and the expiration window of the certificate of the
    callback url. The generation of the proxy-granting-ticket or the corresponding
    proxy granting ticket IOU may fail due to the proxy callback url failing to meet the minimum
    security requirements such as failure to establishing trust between peers or unresponsiveness
    of the endpoint, etc. In case of failure, no proxy-granting ticket will be issued and the CAS
    service response as described in Section [2.5.2](#head2.5.2) MUST NOT contain a
    `<proxyGrantingTicket>` block. At this point, the issuance of a
    proxy-granting ticket is halted and service ticket validation will
    fail. Otherwise, the process will proceed normally to step 2.

2.  CAS uses an HTTP GET request to pass the HTTP request parameters `pgtId` and
    `pgtIou` to the pgtUrl endpoint. These entities are discussed in Sections [3.3](#head3.3) and
    [3.4](#head3.4), respectively. If the proxy callback url specifies any parameters, those
    MUST be preserved. CAS MUST also ensure that the endpoint is reachable by verifying
    the response HTTP status code from the GET request, as detailed in step #3. If the
    proxy service fails to authenticate or the endpoint responds with an unacceptable status
    code, proxy authentication MUST fail and CAS MUST respond with the appropriate error code
    as is described in section [2.5.3](<#head2.5.3>).

3.  If the HTTP GET returns an HTTP status code of 200 (OK), CAS MUST respond to
    the `/serviceValidate` (or `/proxyValidate`) request with a service response
    (Section [2.5.2](#head2.5.2)) containing the proxy-granting ticket IOU (Section [3.4](#head3.4))
    within the `<cas:proxyGrantingTicket>` block. If the HTTP GET returns any
    other status code, except HTTP 3xx redirects, CAS MUST respond to the
    `/serviceValidate` (or `/proxyValidate`) request with a service response that
    MUST NOT contain a `<cas:proxyGrantingTicket>` block. CAS MAY follow any HTTP
    redirects issued by the `pgtUrl`. However, the identifying callback URL
    provided upon validation in the `<proxy>` block MUST be the same URL that was
    initially passed to `/serviceValidate` (or `/proxyValidate`) as the `pgtUrl`
    parameter.

4.  The service, having received a proxy-granting ticket IOU in the CAS
    response, and both a proxy-granting ticket and a proxy-granting ticket IOU
    from the proxy callback, will use the proxy-granting ticket IOU to correlate
    the proxy-granting ticket with the validation response. The service will
    then use the proxy-granting ticket for the acquisition of proxy tickets as
    described in Section [2.7](#head2.7).

### **2.5.5. attributes [CAS 3.0]**

[CAS 3.0] The response document MAY include an optional <cas:attributes>
element for additional authentication and/or user attributes. See [Appendix
A](<#head_appdx_a>) for details.

<a name="head2.5.6"/>

### **2.5.6. URL examples of /serviceValidate**

Simple validation attempt:

`https://cas.example.org/cas/serviceValidate?service=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.org%2Fservice&ticket=ST-1856339-aA5Yuvrxzpv8Tau1cYQ7`

Ensure service ticket was issued by presentation of primary credentials:

`https://cas.example.org/cas/serviceValidate?service=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.org%2Fservice&ticket=ST-1856339-aA5Yuvrxzpv8Tau1cYQ7&renew=true
`

Pass in a callback URL for proxying:

`https://cas.example.org/cas/serviceValidate?service=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.org%2Fservice&ticket=ST-1856339-aA5Yuvrxzpv8Tau1cYQ7&pgtUrl=https://www.example.org%2Fservice%2FproxyCallback`

**2.6. /proxyValidate [CAS 2.0]**
---------------------------------

`/proxyValidate` MUST perform the same validation tasks as `/serviceValidate` and
additionally validate proxy tickets. `/proxyValidate` MUST be capable of
validating both service tickets and proxy tickets. See Section
[2.5.4](<#head2.5.4>) for details.



<a name="head2.6.1"/>

### **2.6.1. parameters**

`/proxyValidate` has the same parameter requirements as `/serviceValidate`. See
Section [2.5.1](<#head2.5.1>).



<a name="head2.6.2"/>

### **2.6.2. response**

`/proxyValidate` will return an XML-formatted CAS serviceResponse as described in
the XML schema in Appendix A. Below are example responses:

Response on ticket validation success:

```xml
  <cas:serviceResponse xmlns:cas="http://www.yale.edu/tp/cas">
    <cas:authenticationSuccess>

    }
  }
}
```


>   Note: when authentication has proceeded through multiple proxies, the order
>   in which the proxies were traversed MUST be reflected in the <cas:proxies>
>   block. The most recently-visited proxy MUST be the first proxy listed, and
>   all the other proxies MUST be shifted down as new proxies are added. In the
>   above example, the service identified by <https://proxy1/pgtUrl> was
>   visited first, and that service proxied authentication to the service
>   identified by <https://proxy2/pgtUrl>.

Response on ticket validation failure:

```xml
  <cas:serviceResponse xmlns:cas='http://www.yale.edu/tp/cas'>
      <cas:authenticationFailure code="INVALID_TICKET">

### **2.6.3 error codes**

See section [2.5.3](<#head2.5.3>)



<a name="head2.6.4"/>

### **2.6.4 URL examples of /proxyValidate**

`/proxyValidate` accepts the same parameters as `/serviceValidate`. See Section
[2.5.5](<#head2.5.5>) for use examples, substituting "proxyValidate" for
"serviceValidate".



<a name="head2.7"/>

**2.7. /proxy [CAS 2.0]**
-------------------------

`/proxy` provides proxy tickets to services that have acquired proxy-granting
tickets and will be proxying authentication to back-end services.


<a name="head2.7.1"/>

### **2.7.1. parameters**

The following HTTP request parameters MUST be specified to `/proxy`. They are both
case-sensitive.

-   `pgt` [REQUIRED] - the proxy-granting ticket acquired by the service during
    service ticket or proxy ticket validation.
-   `targetService` [REQUIRED] - the service identifier of the back-end service.
    Note that not all back-end services are web services so this service identifier
    will not always be an URL. However, the service identifier specified here
    MUST match the `service` parameter specified to `/proxyValidate` upon validation
    of the proxy ticket.


<a name="head2.7.2"/>

### **2.7.2. response**

`/proxy` will return an XML-formatted CAS serviceResponse document as described in the XML
schema in [Appendix A](#head_appdx_a). Below are example responses:

Response on request success:

```xml
  <cas:serviceResponse xmlns:cas="http://www.yale.edu/tp/cas">
      <cas:proxySuccess>
          <cas:proxyTicket>PT-1856392-b98xZrQN4p90ASrw96c8</cas:proxyTicket>
      </cas:proxySuccess>
  </cas:serviceResponse>
```

Response on request failure:

```xml
<cas:serviceResponse xmlns:cas="http://www.yale.edu/tp/cas">
      <cas:proxyFailure code="INVALID_REQUEST">
          'pgt' and 'targetService' parameters are both required
      </cas:proxyFailure>
  </cas:serviceResponse>
```

```json
{
  "serviceResponse" : {
    "authenticationFailure" : {
      "code" : "INVALID_REQUEST",
      "description" : "'pgt' and 'targetService' parameters are both required"
    }
  }
}
```

<a name="head2.7.3"/>

### **2.7.3. error codes**

The following values MAY be used as the `code` attribute of authentication
failure responses. The following is the minimum set of error codes that all CAS
servers MUST implement. Implementations MAY include others.

-   `INVALID_REQUEST` - not all of the required request parameters were present

-   `UNAUTHORIZED_SERVICE` - service is unauthorized to perform the proxy request

-   `INTERNAL_ERROR` - an internal error occurred during ticket validation

For all error codes, it is RECOMMENDED that CAS provide a more detailed message
as the body of the <cas:authenticationFailure> block of the XML response.



<a name="head2.7.4"/>

### **2.7.4. URL example of /proxy**

Simple proxy request:

`https://server/cas/proxy?targetService=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.service.com&pgt=PGT-490649-W81Y9Sa2vTM7hda7xNTkezTbVge4CUsybAr`


<a name="head3"/>

### **2.7.4 Service Ticket Lifecycle implications**
The CAS Server implementation MAY update the parent Service Ticket (ST) lifetime upon proxy ticket generation.

**2.8. /p3/serviceValidate [CAS 3.0]**
---------------------------------

`/p3/serviceValidate` MUST perform the same validation tasks as `/serviceValidate` and
additionally return user attributes in the CAS response. See
Section [2.5](<#head2.5>) and Section [2.5.7](<#head2.5.7>) for details.

<a name="head2.8.1"/>

### **2.8.1. parameters**

`/p3/serviceValidate` has the same parameter requirements as `/serviceValidate`. See
Section [2.5.1](<#head2.5.1>).

**2.9. /p3/proxyValidate [CAS 3.0]**
---------------------------------

`/p3/proxyValidate` MUST perform the same validation tasks as `/p3/serviceValidate` and
additionally validate proxy tickets. See Section [2.8](<#head2.5>).

<a name="head2.8.1"/>

### **2.9.1. parameters**

`/p3/proxyValidate` has the same parameter requirements as `/p3/serviceValidate`. See
Section [2.8.1](<#head2.8.1>).

**3. CAS Entities**
===================

<a name="head3.1"/>

**3.1. service ticket**
-----------------------

A service ticket is an opaque string that is used by the client as a credential
to obtain access to a service. The service ticket is obtained from CAS upon a
client's presentation of credentials and a service identifier to `/login` as
described in Section [2.2](#head2.2).

<a name="head3.1.1"/>

### **3.1.1. service ticket properties**

-   Service tickets are only valid for the service identifier that was specified
    to `/login` when they were generated. The service identifier SHOULD NOT be
    part of the service ticket.

-   Service tickets MUST only be valid for one ticket validation attempt.
    Whether or not validation was successful, CAS MUST then invalidate the ticket,
    causing all future validation attempts of that same ticket to fail.

-   CAS SHOULD expire unvalidated service tickets in a reasonable period of time
    after they are issued. If a service presents an expired service ticket for
    validation, CAS MUST respond with a validation failure response.

-   It is RECOMMENDED that the validation response include a descriptive message
    explaining why validation failed.

-   It is RECOMMENDED that the duration a service ticket is valid before it expires
    be no longer than five minutes. Local security and CAS usage considerations
    MAY determine the optimal lifespan of unvalidated service tickets.

-   Service tickets MUST contain adequate secure random data so that a ticket is
    not guessable.
-   Service tickets MUST begin with the characters, `ST-`.

-   Services MUST be able to accept service tickets of up to 32 characters in length.
    It is RECOMMENDED that services support service tickets of up to 256 characters in
    length.



<a name="head3.2"/>

**3.2. proxy ticket**
---------------------

A proxy ticket is an opaque string that a service uses as a credential to obtain
access to a back-end service on behalf of a client. Proxy tickets are obtained
from CAS upon a service's presentation of a valid proxy-granting ticket (Section
[3.3](<#head3.3>)), and a service identifier for the back-end service to which
it is connecting.



<a name="head3.2.1"/>

### **3.2.1. proxy ticket properties**

-   Proxy tickets are only valid for the service identifier specified to `/proxy`
    when they were generated. The service identifier SHOULD NOT be part of the
    proxy ticket.

-   Proxy tickets MUST only be valid for one ticket validation attempt.
    Whether or not validation was successful, CAS MUST then invalidate
    the ticket, causing all future validation attempts of that same ticket to
    fail.

-   CAS SHOULD expire unvalidated proxy tickets in a reasonable period
    of time after they are issued. If a service presents for validation an
    expired proxy ticket, CAS MUST respond with a validation failure response.

-   It is RECOMMENDED that the validation response include a descriptive message
    explaining why validation failed.

-   It is RECOMMENDED that the duration a proxy ticket is valid before it expires
    be no longer than five minutes. Local security and CAS usage considerations
    MAY determine the optimal lifespan of unvalidated proxy tickets.

-   Proxy tickets MUST contain adequate secure random data so that a ticket is
    not guessable.

-   Proxy tickets SHOULD begin with the characters, `PT-`.

-   Back-end services MUST be able to accept proxy tickets of up to 32 characters
    in length.

-   It is RECOMMENDED that back-end services support proxy tickets of up to 256
    characters in length.



<a name="head3.3"/>

**3.3. proxy-granting ticket**
------------------------------

A proxy-granting ticket (PGT) is an opaque string that is used by a service to obtain
proxy tickets for obtaining access to a back-end service on behalf of a client.
Proxy-granting tickets are obtained from CAS upon validation of a service ticket
or a proxy ticket. Proxy-granting ticket issuance is described fully in Section
[2.5.4](<#head2.5.4>).



<a name="head3.3.1"/>

### **3.3.1. proxy-granting ticket properties**

-   Proxy-granting tickets MAY be used by services to obtain multiple proxy
    tickets. Proxy-granting tickets are not one-time-use tickets.

-   Proxy-granting tickets MUST expire when the client whose authentication is
    being proxied logs out of CAS.

-   Proxy-granting tickets MUST contain adequate secure random data so that a
    ticket is not guessable in a reasonable period of time through brute-force
    attacks.

-   Proxy-granting tickets SHOULD begin with the characters `PGT-`.

-   Services MUST be able to handle proxy-granting tickets of up to 64
    characters in length.

-   It is RECOMMENDED that services support proxy-granting tickets of up to
    256 characters in length.



<a name="head3.4"/>

**3.4. proxy-granting ticket IOU**
----------------------------------

A proxy-granting ticket IOU is an opaque string that is placed in the response
provided by `/serviceValidate` and `/proxyValidate` used to correlate a service
ticket or proxy ticket validation with a particular proxy-granting ticket. See
Section [2.5.4](<#head2.5.4>) for a full description of this process.



<a name="head3.4.1"/>

### **3.4.1. proxy-granting ticket IOU properties**

-   Proxy-granting ticket IOUs SHOULD NOT contain any reference to their
    associated proxy-granting tickets. Given a particular PGTIOU, it MUST NOT be
    possible to derive its corresponding PGT through algorithmic methods in a
    reasonable period of time.

-   Proxy-granting ticket IOUs MUST contain adequate secure random data so that
    a ticket is not guessable in a reasonable period of time through brute-force
    attacks.

-   Proxy-granting ticket IOUs SHOULD begin with the characters, `PGTIOU-`.

-   Services MUST be able to handle PGTIOUs of up to 64 characters in length. It
    is RECOMMENDED that services support PGTIOUs of up to 256 characters in
    length.



<a name="head3.5"/>

**3.5. login ticket**
---------------------

A login ticket is an *optional* string that MAY be provided by `/login` as a credential requester
and passed to `/login` as a credential acceptor for username/password
authentication. Its purpose is to prevent the replaying of credentials due to
bugs in web browsers.


<a name="head3.5.1"/>

### **3.5.1. login ticket properties**

-   Login tickets issued by `/login` MUST be probabilistically unique.

-   Login tickets MUST only be valid for one authentication attempt. Whether or
    not authentication was successful, CAS MUST then invalidate the login
    ticket, causing all future authentication attempts with that instance of
    that login ticket to fail.

-   Login tickets SHOULD begin with the characters `LT-`.

<a name="head3.6"/>

**3.6. ticket-granting cookie**
-------------------------------

A ticket-granting cookie is an HTTP cookie[[5](<#5>)] set by CAS upon the
establishment of a single sign-on session. This cookie maintains login state for
the client, and while it is valid, the client can present it to CAS in lieu of
primary credentials. Services can opt out of single sign-on through the `renew`
parameter described in Sections [2.1.1](<#head2.1.1>), [2.4.1](<#head2.4.1>),
and [2.5.1](<#head2.5.1>).



<a name="head3.6.1"/>

### **3.6.1. ticket-granting cookie properties**

-   A ticket-granting cookie SHALL be set to expire at the end of the client's
    browser session if Long-Term support is not active ([4.1.1](<#head4.1.1>))
    for the corresponding TGT.

-   CAS SHALL set the cookie path to be as restrictive as possible. For example,
    if the CAS server is set up under the path /cas, the cookie path SHALL be set
    to /cas.

-   The value of ticket-granting cookies SHALL contain adequate secure random data
    so that a ticket-granting cookie is not guessable in a reasonable period of time.

-   The name of ticket-granting cookies SHOULD begin with the characters `TGC-`.

-   The value of ticket-granting cookies SHOULD follow the same rules as the ticket-granting
    ticket. Typically, the value of the ticket-granting cookies MAY contain the ticket-granting
    ticket itself as the representation of the authenticated single sign-on session.

<a name="head3.7"/>

**3.7. ticket and ticket-granting cookie character set**
--------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the above requirements, all CAS tickets and the value of the
ticket-granting cookie MUST contain only characters from the set `{A-Z, a-z, 0-9}`,
and the hyphen character `-`.


<a name="head3.8"/>

**3.8. ticket-granting ticket**
------------------------------

A ticket-granting ticket (TGT) is an opaque string that is generated by the CAS
server that is issued upon an successful authentication event upon `/login`.
This ticket may be tied to the ticket-granting cookie which represents the
state of the single sign-on session, with validity period and acts as the
foundation and baseline for issuance of service tickets, proxy-granting
tickets, and more.

<a name="head3.8.1"/>

### **3.8.1. ticket-granting ticket properties**

-   Ticket-granting tickets MAY be used by services to obtain multiple service
    tickets. Ticket-granting tickets are not one-time-use tickets and are associated
    with a validity period and expiration policy.

-   Ticket-granting tickets MUST expire when the client whose authentication is
    being managed logs out of CAS.

-   Ticket-granting tickets MUST contain adequate secure random data so that a
    ticket is not guessable in a reasonable period of time through brute-force
    attacks.

-   Ticket-granting tickets SHOULD begin with the characters `TGT-`.

-   It is RECOMMENDED that ticket-granting tickets be encrypted when
    shared with other external resources in order to minimize security
    vulnerabilities as they are tied to the ticket-granting cookie
    and represent the authentication session.


<a name="head4"/>

**4. Optional Features**
========================

<a name="head4.1"/>

**4.1 Long-Term Tickets - Remember-Me [CAS 3.0]**
-------------------------------------------------

CAS Server MAY support Long-Term Ticket Granting Tickets (referred to as
"Remember Me" functionality). If this feature is supported by the CAS Server, it
is possible to perform recurring, non interactive re-logins to the CAS Server as
long as the Long-Term Ticket Granting Ticket in the CAS Server is not expired
and the browsers TGC Cookie is valid.


<a name="head4.1.1"/>

### **4.1.1 Enabling Remember-Me (Login Page)**

-   The CAS Server MUST provide a checkbox on the login page to allow Remember-Me
functionality.

-   By default, the checkbox MUST be unchecked.

-   It MUST be the users choice to enable Remember-Me for the login or not.
    See Section [2.2.2](<#head2.2.2>).



<a name="head4.1.2"/>

### **4.1.2 Security implications**

Enabling Remember-Me MAY have security implications. As the CAS authentication
is bound to the browser and the user is not getting interactively logged-in when
a valid Long-Term TGT ticket exists and the CAS cookie presented by the browser
is valid, special care MUST be taken on the CAS client side to handle Remember-Me
logins properly. It MUST be the CAS clients responsibility to decide
if and when Remember-Me CAS logins might be handled special. See [4.1.3](<#head4.1.3>).



<a name="head4.1.3"/>

### **4.1.3 CAS Validation Response Attributes**

As only the CAS Client MUST decide how to handle Remember-Me logins (see
[4.2.1](<#head4.2.1>)), the CAS Server MUST provide information about a
Remember-Me login to the CAS Client. This information MUST be provided by all
ticket validation methods supported by the CAS Server (See Sections
[2.5](<#head2.5>), [2.6](<#head2.6>) and [2.8](<#head2.8>)) in this case.

-   In serviceValidate XML responses (see [Appendix A](<#head_appdx_a>)), a
Remember-Me login MUST be indicated by the
`longTermAuthenticationRequestTokenUsed` attribute. Additionally, the
`isFromNewLogin` attribute MAY be used to decide whether this has security
implications.

-   In SAML validation responses, Remember-Me MUST be indicated by the
`longTermAuthenticationRequestTokenUsed` attribute.



<a name="head4.1.4"/>

### **4.1.4 CAS Client requirements**

If the CAS client needs to handle Remember-Me logins special (e.g. deny access to
sensitive areas of the CAS client application on a remembered login), the CAS
client MUST NOT use the `/validate` CAS validation URL, as this URL does not
support CAS attributes in the validation response document.


### **4.1.5 Long-Term ticket-granting cookie properties**

When a Long-Term TGT was created by the CAS Server, the Ticket-granting cookie
MUST NOT expire at the end of the client's browser session as defined in [3.6.1](<#head3.6.1>).
Instead, the Ticket Granting cookie SHALL expire at the defined Long-Term TGT ticket lifetime.

The lifetime value definition of Long-Term Ticket Granting Tickets is up to the CAS Server implementer.
The Long-Term Ticket Granting Ticket lifetime MAY not exceed 3 months.


<a name="head4.2"/>

**4.2 /samlValidate [CAS 3.0]**
-------------------------------

`/samlValidate` checks the validity of a Service Ticket by a SAML 1.1 request
document provided by a HTTP POST. A SAML (Secure Access Markup Language)[7](#7) 1.1
response document MUST be returned. This allows the release of additional
information (attributes) of the authenticated NetID. The Security Assertion
Markup Language (SAML) describes a document and protocol framework by which
security assertions (such as assertions about a prior act of authentication) can
be exchanged.



<a name="head4.2.1"/>

### **4.2.1 parameters**

The following HTTP request parameters MUST be specified to `/samlValidate`. They
are both case-sensitive.

-   `TARGET` [REQUIRED] - URL encoded service identifier of the back-end service.
    Note that as an HTTP request parameter, this URL value MUST be URL-encoded
    as described in Section 2.2 of RFC 1738[[4]](#4). The service identifier
    specified here MUST match the `service` parameter provided to `/login`. See
    Section [2.1.1](<#head2.1.1>). The `TARGET` service SHALL use HTTPS. SAML
    attributes MUST NOT be released to a non-SSL site.



<a name="head4.2.2"/>

### **4.2.2 HTTP Request Method and Body**

Request to /samlValidate MUST be a HTTP POST request. The request body MUST be a valid
SAML 1.0 or 1.1 request XML document of document type "text/xml".



<a name="head4.2.3"/>

### **4.2.3 SAML request values**

-   `RequestID` [REQUIRED] - unique identifier for the request

-   `IssueInstant` [REQUIRED] - timestamp of the request

-   `samlp:AssertionArtifact` [REQUIRED] - the valid CAS Service Ticket obtained as a response
    parameter at login. See section [2.2.4](<#head2.2.4>).



<a name="head4.2.4"/>

### **4.2.4 Example of /samlValidate POST request**

```bash
POST /cas/samlValidate?TARGET=
Host: cas.example.com
Content-Length: 491
Content-Type: text/xml

### **4.2.5.1 SAML CAS response attributes**

The following additional attributes might be provided within the SAML response:

-   `longTermAuthenticationRequestTokenUsed` - If Long Term Ticket Granting
Tickets (Remember-Me) are supported by the CAS Server (see Section [4.1](<#head4.1>)), the
SAML response MUST include this attribute to indicate remembered logins
to the CAS client.

**Appendix B: Safe redirection**
================================

After a successful login, safely redirecting the client from CAS to its final
destination must be handled with care. In most cases, the client has sent
credentials to the CAS server over a POST request. By this specification, the
CAS server must then forward the user to the application with a GET request.

The HTTP/1.1 RFC[[3](<#3>)] provides a response code of 303: See Other, which
provides for the desired behavior: a script that receives data through a POST
request can, through a 303 redirection, forward the browser to another URL
through a GET request. However, not all browsers have implemented this behavior
correctly.

The RECOMMENDED method of redirection is thus JavaScript. A page containing a
`window.location.href` in the following manner performs adequately:

```html
 <html>
    <head>
        <title>Yale Central Authentication Service</title>
        <script>
            window.location.href="https://portal.yale.edu/Login?ticket=ST-..."
mce_href="https://portal.yale.edu/Login?ticket=ST-...";`
       </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <noscript>
            <p>CAS login successful.</p>
            <p>  Click <a xhref="https://portal.yale.edu/Login?ticket=ST-..."
mce_href="https://portal.yale.edu/Login?ticket=ST-...">here</a>
            to access the service you requested.<br />  </p>
        </noscript>
    </body>
 </html>
```


Additionally, CAS should disable browser caching by setting all of the various
cache-related headers:

-   Pragma: no-cache

-   Cache-Control: no-store

-   Expires: [RFC 1123[6] date equal to or before now]

The introduction of the login ticket removed the possibility of CAS accepting
credentials that were cached and replayed by a browser. However, early versions
of Apple's Safari browser contained a bug where through usage of the Back
button, Safari could be coerced into presenting the client's credentials to the
service it is trying to access. CAS can prevent this behavior by not
automatically redirecting if it detects that the remote browser is one of these
early versions of Safari. Instead, CAS should display a page that states login
was successful, and provide a link to the requested service. The client must
then manually click to proceed.

**Appendix C: Logout XML document**
===================================

When SLO is supported by the CAS Server, it will callback to each of the
services that are registered with the system and send a POST request with the
following SAML Logout Request XML document:


```xml
  <samlp:LogoutRequest xmlns:samlp="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol"
     ID="[RANDOM ID]" Version="2.0" IssueInstant="[CURRENT DATE/TIME]">
    <saml:NameID xmlns:saml="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion">
      @NOT_USED@
    </saml:NameID>
    <samlp:SessionIndex>[SESSION IDENTIFIER]</samlp:SessionIndex>
  </samlp:LogoutRequest>`
