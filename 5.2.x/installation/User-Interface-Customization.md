title: CAS - User Interface Customization
---


# Overview

Branding the CAS User Interface (UI) involves simply editing the CSS stylesheet and also a small collection of relatively simple HTML include files, also known as views. Optionally, you may also wish to modify the text displayed and/or add additional Javascript effects
on these views.

# Browser Support

CAS user interface should properly and comfortably lend itself to all major browser vendors:

* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* Apple Safari
* Microsoft Internet Explorer

Note that certain older version of IE, particularly IE 9 and below may impose additional difficulty in getting the right UI configuration in place.

## Internet Explorer

To instruct CAS to render UI in compatibility mode, the following is added automatically to relevant UI components:

```html
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
```
