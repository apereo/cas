# Sending Email

CAS presents the ability to notify users on select actions via email messages. Example actions include notification of risky authentication attempts or password reset links/tokens. SMS providers supported by CAS are listed below. Note that an active/professional subscription may be required for certain providers.

Configuring an email provider is simply a matter of defining settings. Each particular feature in need of email functionality should be able to gracefully continue in case settings are not defined. 
To see the relevant list of CAS properties, please [review this guide](Configuration-Properties.html#email-submissions).
