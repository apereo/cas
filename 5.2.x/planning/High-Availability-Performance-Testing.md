# High Availability Performance Testing

Load testing is an important part of ensuring that the CAS server deployment is ready for prime time production use. This page outlines a number of strategies and tools you may use to run performance tests on your deployment and observe results.

## Locust

[Locust](http://locust.io/) is an easy-to-use, distributed, user load testing tool. It is intended for load-testing web sites (or other systems) and figuring out how many concurrent users a system can handle. [See this guide](Performance-Testing-Locust.html) for more info.

## JMeter

Apache JMeter is a great performance testing tool that is used heavily within the Java community.
